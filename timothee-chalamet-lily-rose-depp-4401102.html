Their relationship seemed destined: they were movie co-stars,&nbsp; both bilingual in French and English thanks to their multi-cultural parents (Lily-Rose‚Äôs mother is famous French singer <strong>Vanessa Paradis</strong>, 48), and of course, are undeniably cool (Lily‚Äôs dad is also one of the most famous actors in the world, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Johnny Depp</strong></a>, while Timoth√©e is an Oscar-nominated actor). Fans swooned over their relationship ‚Äî and are doing so once again, thanks to recent rumors that they are back together! We explain that all and more in our breakdown of Timoth√©e and Lily-Rose‚Äôs relationship timeline below.</p><h2><span><span><i>Who is Lily-Rose Depp</i></span></span></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Like most actors, Timoth√©e and Lily-Rose‚Äôs story began on a movie set. They met while filming the Netflix film, The King, in 2018. Timoth√©e played Henry V and Lily-Rose took on the role of Catherine of Valois; their characters end up marrying at the end of the movie, which they close out in the iconic scene above.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>But their love story didn‚Äôt end on the screen. By October of 2018, Timoth√©e and Lily-Rose began stirring up <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dating speculation</a> thanks to their outings together in New York City spots like Central Park and Mud Coffee. The romance was pretty much confirmed when they were photographed kissing in the rain ‚Äî yes, because they are true romantics ‚Äî by the end of the month. They were also spotted roaming the streets of Paris (where Lily-Rose was born) amid the Christmas season in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Timothee-Chalamet-Lily-Rose-Depp-Romance-Relived-backgrid-post.jpg>This romance carried into 2019, even if Timoth√©e and Lily-Rose‚Äôs social media pages didn‚Äôt indicate this (they weren‚Äôt the type of couple to spam their Instagram pages with PDA posts). Just days after the 2019 Venice Film Festival ‚Äî where the still-rumored couple was photographed looking giddily at each other during their premiere for The King&nbsp;‚Äî they WERE seen packing on PDA on a yacht in Italy, however. The makeout session was so intense, it birthed a meme ‚Äî something that Timoth√©e later looked back at <a href=#>with embarrassment</a> (to clarify, not because of his PDA with Lily-Rose, but because of how he looked in the viral photos). <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Timothee-Chalamet-Lily-Rose-Depp-Romance-Relived-backgrid-post-2.jpg>Alas, the romance did not survive far into 2020. Timoth√©e revealed that he was ‚Äú<a href=#>currently single</a>‚Äù in an interview with British&nbsp;Vogue&nbsp;in April of that year. That means Timoth√©e and Lily-Rose dated roughly between late 2018-early 2020‚Ä¶but they may be together once again, according to a new report (more on that below).<p id=content-paragraph-7>Lily-Rose is also known for far more beyond her relationship with her co-star. She is following in the steps of her famous father, Johnny Depp, as an actress: her first leading role was in the 2016 comedy Yoga Hosers, and she showed off her fluent French in the 2018 drama film L‚Äôhomme fid√®le. In her most recent role, Lily-Rose plays an astronaut in the mind-bending thriller Voyagers,&nbsp;which came out in April of 2021.</p><h2><strong><strong>Timoth√©e‚Äôs Relationship with Lily&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>TIMOTH√âE CHALAMET E AND LILY-ROSE DEPP SPOTTED TOGETHER IM CRYING <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/zKCrONpJbU</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>‚Äî üìù (@valesonni) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>March 31, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Rumors spread that Lily-Rose and Timoth√©e were allegedly spotted together in March of 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class=p1>So, where does that leave Lily-Rose and Timoth√©e now? Well, it was clear that the co-stars were over ‚Äî at least for the time being ‚Äî when Timoth√©e was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted kissing</a> Baby Driver&nbsp;star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Eiza Gonz√°lez</strong></a>, 31, in a hot tub in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico in June of 2020. While news surrounding Timoth√©e and Lily-Rose went radio silent through that year, it sparked back up in 2021 thanks to big news. Timoth√©e and Lily-Rose were allegedly ‚Äúback together,‚Äù according to an In Touch report that surfaced in April.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre both super happy,‚Äù a source told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>In Touch</a>, adding, that their ‚Äúrelationship is going really well.‚Äù The insider added, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a private couple and are keeping their romance out of the spotlight. It works better for them that way.‚Äù</p><p class=p1>Twitter celebrated the alleged reunion of their ‚Äúmom and dad,‚Äù which is what one fan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called</a> the iconic duo. Amid this buzz, neither Timoth√©e nor Lily-Rose have confirmed it this is actually true (which is not a surprise for the notoriously private actors).</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>So, that‚Äôs a wrap on the relationship timeline between the&nbsp;Call Me By Your Name&nbsp;star and the daughter of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis. To sum it up, Timoth√©e and Lily-Rose met on&nbsp;The King&nbsp;in 2018, they fell for one another, but then were over by the beginning of 2021. However, as you now know, we may have entered a new era of Timoth√©e and Lily-Rose‚Ä¶at least a new wave of dating rumors, that is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OipKismJqybq%2FHmqOapZWpeq21y7Jkq6ejmnqlsc%2BpZG1sYGZ%2BcX6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
