The Chicago native, 32, initially found herself connecting with <a href=#><strong>Kyle Abrams</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Shayne Jansen</strong></a>. Hurley ended up getting engaged to Abrams, 29, in the pods, but she later told Jansen, 32, <a href=#>about her feelings for him.</a></p><p>Hurley and Abrams <a href=#>called it quits after leaving the pods</a> ahead of the reunion special, which was released earlier this month. At the time, Hurley opened up about <a href=#>feeling pressured to accept a proposal</a> that she wasn’t ready for. “It was a people-pleasing moment and I should have never said yes to you. I should have never said yes,” she shared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Love-Is-Blinds-Shaina-Hurley-Is-Engaged-to-Boyfriend-Christos-Lardakis-After-Kyle-Abrams-Split2.jpg><p>The hairstylist later admitted that she wasn’t sure if the contractor was the right person for her when they met on the hit Netflix series.</p><p>“Because even before he proposed, I was like, ‘I don’t know how it’s gonna work.’ … I was trying to be open-minded because this is an experiment,” she explained on the “Viall Files” podcast on March 2. “This was, like, 10 days — people are acting like this was years. … During the reveal, I had [the] intention, [then] I’m like, ‘You know what? I don’t know if we should be doing this.’ And when I saw him, it was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is real.'”</p><p>Hurley also noted that a pivotal conversation between her and her now ex-fiancé <a href=#>ended up not making it into the show</a>. “I was very honest with Kyle and I had told them like, ‘I can’t do this,'” she added at the time. “I broke up with him for a reason. And I had explained that to him in Mexico, and I wanted to go home. I was kind of over it at that point. And I just needed to see my family again, like, we weren’t able to see them for about three weeks, so I had no outside influence.”</p><p>During the podcast, Hurley revealed that she has <a href=#>since moved on with her “pretty serious” boyfriend</a>, saying, “He’s been great throughout the whole situation. I’m happy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Netflix personality went on to <a href=#>make her romance with Lardakis Instagram official</a> on Sunday, March 13, writing, “My ride or die forever ♾ ❤️‍🔥 ✞.” The social media upload included a compilation of moments from a trip to Mykonos.</p><p><a href=#>People</a> was first to report the news.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6aaeqq%2FjJujoqaUqHq0tMCipZplmah6prrGmp6enF2pvG6vx6ugrGWclr%2BlrcqiqmaZlqmys3nKsqOeZaOluarAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
