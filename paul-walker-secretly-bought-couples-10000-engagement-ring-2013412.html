Remembrances of the late 40-year-old actor have been pouring in since <a href=#>his tragic death on Saturday, Nov. 30</a>, and now another recipient of Walker’s kindness has come forward. According to one jewelry store sales associate, the Fast and the Furious star once bought an Iraqi vet’s fiancee an engagement ring — in secret.</p><p>Several years ago during the holiday season, the handsome actor walked into Bailey Banks and Biddle Jewelers in Santa Barbara, Calif., and witnessed a couple looking through engagement rings. After overhearing that a ring worth $10,000 was too expensive for them, Walker stepped in. <a href=#>See more pics of him here</a>.</p><p>“It was such a heartwarming story,” the sales associate, <strong>Irene King</strong>, recalled to CBS Los Angeles. According to King, Walker asked the store manager quietly to put the ring “on his tab.” He asked for the employees to keep his identity hidden, and walked out the door.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, King realized it was the famous Hollywood hunk only after a fellow associate nudged her. “There’s Paul Walker,” her coworker said. “Oh, okay, yeah,” King recalled she replied back. “I said, ‘Yeah, he’s a nice-looking man.'”</p><p>Nice looking, and unusually generous and thoughtful. “To do something like that to a perfect stranger is just unbelievable,” King said. And as it turns out, the store did keep up their end of the bargain. The couple was never told who their benefactor was all those years ago — until now.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><a href=#>Walker was killed in a fiery crash</a> in Southern California in a Porsche Carerra GT.
