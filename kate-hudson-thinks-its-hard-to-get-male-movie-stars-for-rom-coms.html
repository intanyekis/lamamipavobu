I think there’s this sort of misconception that a rom-com is supposed to have a certain formula — which it does, there is a formula that works,” she said. “But it does also start with the writing.”</p><p>For How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Hudson said they went through “multiple writers” before settling on <strong>Kristen Buckley</strong>,<strong> Brian Regan</strong> and <strong>Burr Steers</strong>, and “really made sure we had a great foundation of a script, and then the cast.” (The movie is based on a novel written by <strong>Michele Alexander</strong> and <strong>Jeannie Long</strong>.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kate-Hudson-Thinks-Its-Hard-to-Get-Male-Movie-Stars-for-Rom-Coms-771.jpg><p>When cohost <strong>Sunny Hosin</strong> noted that “the cast was pretty good,” Hudson added with a laugh, “We like that McConaughey!”</p><p>McConaughey, 54, was known for his roles in various ‘90s and early 2000s romantic comedies, including How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, The Wedding Planner and more. The Oscar winner previously gave <a href=#>behind-the-scenes insight</a> into the genre in 2020, noting the importance of chemistry between a film’s leads.</p><p>“There’s a lot of improv, there’s a lot of banter. It’s about timing, comedic timing,” he explained in a video shared to X (formerly Twitter) at the time. “There’s a buoyancy that they’re built on, you have to sort of bounce from cloud to cloud. Dance between the raindrops, I used to say.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for his onscreen relationship with Hudson, he said that the pair “had great chemistry.”</p><p>“But we had a really good push and pull,” he recalled. “She had a lot of rock n’ roll and I did too, the way we would parry with each other really worked in that film.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarJVitbaw0qilZqyYnrusv4yiq6xlmJa%2FpXnTqGSgnaRiuqK4xGakqK6Zmnq0wMCrqmaen6d6s7vMZpqopaNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
