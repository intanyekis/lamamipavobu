He and Gigi Hadid have shared custody of her, and the singer treasures the time he has with her more than anything.</p><p><strong>Recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he gushed about the joys of fatherhood</a>, and shared a glimpse of how he's raising his daughter, who is growing to love nature and the calm and solitude of farm life in rural Pennsylvania</strong>.</p><p>"When I found out that my partner at the time was pregnant, I pretty quickly made up my mind that this would be a great place to raise a child because there's so much for her to do here," he shared. "<strong>So, we do spend a lot of time outside. We do the gardening. She likes to camp with me. We cook outside. We fish a little bit. And she’s really into it, too, so it makes it fun. Hopefully, we can create some amazing memories here.</strong>"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This love of outdoor activities and nature also devolved into very healthy eating habits for his young daughter, which is a plus. Zayn grows vegetables himself, and little Khai loves to help out. <strong>"I love gardening," the singer revealed. "I got into it when I moved out here, probably about seven years ago. And now I get to share that experience with her, because I’ve gotten a bit better at things."</strong></p><p>"My crops are actually edible and usable. So it’s really fun to take her out to the garden and show her the vegetable patch and all the different things in the garden, you know, what she can eat and what she can’t. She’s really interested in it. She loves raw vegetables. I’ll just find her, like, munching on a piece of broccoli, which is a parent’s worst nightmare, you know?" He joked. "Whatever way you can get veggies into your kids, right?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-he-handles-co-parenting-with-gigi-hadid>How He Handles Co-parenting With Gigi Hadid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gigi-hadid-and-zayn-malik.jpg><p>Despite the fact that it didn't work out between them, Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid have maintained a very healthy and cordial co-parenting dynamic. They divide custody exactly 50-50, and while they both wish they could have more, they make the most of the time they have.</p><p>"<strong>Co-parenting is good. We have a really good relationship for Khai. She’s the main importance. It’s going well</strong>," Zayn said. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He also stated that, when he's with his daughter, he spends all day with her</a>.
