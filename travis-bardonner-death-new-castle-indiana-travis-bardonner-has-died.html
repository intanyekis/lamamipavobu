We started out as good pals. You have continued to teach me everything you know about AR-15s and Glocks over the course of many years.</p><p>Soon after that, armed with this new information, I began working as a firearms instructor for you. In our ten years together, you were the one who taught me the most. You took a risk for me and helped protect me by taking me under your wing. My other father as well as my closest friend. Angel and I got to know each other because of you and Bethany.</p><p>On the same evening, you were struck in the head with a grappling hook, and I was injured when I fell out of a tree. Because of this, you were selected to serve as the best man at our wedding.<br>Over the course of so many years, we have exchanged countless conversations and ideas with one another. Taking the position of the devil’s advocate with regard to the other ideas. Without you, I never would have been able to get this far in my time behind bars.<br>As I sob my eyes out, I refuse to accept the fact that you are no longer here. I have so many wonderful memories of spending time on the range and watching our children interact with one another. I understand that I failed to bring a lighter with me on our flight, but I was planning to get one before we left for our honeymoon so that we may enjoy some cigars.</p><p>Then, at the airport, I see a lighter on the ground, as if you had put it there, knowing your cheap ass would want me to buy one. Lol However, on the inside, they are as gentle and compassionate as a grizzly bear despite their intimidating exterior. You are posting videos on your Facebook page about firearms and opposition to the government, followed by footage of your children and hummingbirds. My thoughts and prayers are with you, as well as with your loved ones. We will keep a close eye on them and assist them in every manner that we are able, brother.<br>T. W.
