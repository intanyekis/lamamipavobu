The North Carolina emcee made the declaration on Sunday (Dec. 3), taking to Instagram to explain the events that led to him to choosing to put the bottles down for good.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I don’t drink no more,” <a href=#>the “Shake Sumn” creator</a> said, noting that he was “on bedrest” at the time of the making of the clip and had since sobered up after a night of downing shots. “Don’t try to give me no bottles, don’t try to offer me no shot, don’t do none of that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He then threatened to fight anyone who attempts to get him to drink moving forward, vowing to physically assault them on sight. “You offer me a drink from this point forward, I’m stealing the f**k out. It’s a simple as that,” he said. “We gone get to hitting immediately, so you better not be drunk ‘cause I’m going to be sober. I’m stealing off sober.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1501976860.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He then revealed how his intoxication caused him to vomit in his luxury vehicle and partially remove his clothing before exiting the car. Yet, he says what made the moment most embarrassing is that he was in the presence of his young daughter, prompting him to become fully cognizant of his weakened state under the influence.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m throwing up, she beside me in her car seat talking ’bout some ‘Good job,’” DaBaby recalled. “I’m fighting for my life in that back seat and my baby talking about ‘good job.’ Man, it’s embarrassing, in front of my baby. I don’t drink no more.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The hitmaker continued to warn those looking to test his<a href=#> commitment to sobriety</a>, reiterating that he’d willingly put hands on anyone who thinks to extend him alcohol in the future. “I’m stealing off, I dare you. I’m going to be outside tonight, offer me a drink. If you want to fight, offer me a drink” he added. “I don’t give a f**k who it is, I don’t. I don’t give a damn who it is.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See DaBaby’s Instagram post below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5muo63BsmSqrZmpeqW%2ByKeioqaXYrKursCrqZqro567qHnMqKSepqRis7O7za1knZmlnLW1sdFmaGtrZG1%2Fd4OTamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
