We’re going outside more often, driving to more places and enjoying the sunshine. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shades</a> are musts if we don’t want to be squinting all day long, every day, giving ourselves headaches.</p><p>Now is about the right time to pick up <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a new pair</a>, one that’s in style for the current year and will protect our eyes properly. One that will catch people’s attention, but not cost $100 or more. Budget-wise, you’d think we’d have to avoid most celebrity inspiration, but in this case, we landed on a pair of $13 sunnies after seeing a photo of <strong>Hailey Bieber</strong> (née Baldwin) wearing a practically identical pair!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hailey-bieber-full-selfie.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dollger Rectangle Sunglasses in White</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$13</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, April 2, 2021, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Bieber recently posted an outfit selfie on her Instagram Story wearing wearing beige, flared pants, white <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>, a simple white top, an oversized grey blazer with mega-structured shoulders and a pair of white-framed sunglasses with black lenses in a trendy rectangular shape. We wanted those sunglasses, and we wanted them to be inexpensive with fast shipping — because, well, why not? And so we found this Dollger version, and it seriously looks like a clone of Bieber’s!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">These top-rated sunnies</a> have those thick, rectangular white frames for a retro look that’s being rocked by all of today’s top models. These frames are made of hard PC plastic to keep things lightweight, and they’re super durable thanks to their reinforced metal hinges. We also love that the nose pads are integrated into the frame so nothing will be wobbling, flying off or leaving intense indents!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dollger Rectangle Sunglasses in White</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$13</a> at Amazon!

These lenses also claim to block glare and be totally shatterproof, so you don’t have to panic if you accidentally drop them, as we all do!</p><p>The white version of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these shades</a> is the go-to for channeling Bieber’s look, but you can find them in a bunch of other colors, from classics like black and brown to transparent color pops like pink, blue and neon green. Some even come in multi-packs. You’ll also find a few with a different variation on the design, going for a subtle hexagon shape on the frames and adding in metallic accents.
