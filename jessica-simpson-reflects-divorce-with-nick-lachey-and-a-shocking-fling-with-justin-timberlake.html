Hello, my life. I thought."</p><p>She&nbsp;believes that her strong faith and wide-eyed innocent approach to life made Nick reciprocate her feelings, and he proposed four years later. Unfortunately, their marriage lasted less than four years, and the couple divorced in 2006.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Jessica Simpson In 2019</a></span></p><h2 id=she-doesn-t-know-why-nick-was-blindsided-by-their-divorce>She&nbsp;Doesn't Know Why Nick Was Blindsided By Their Divorce</h2><p>Lachey told the press upon his divorce from Simpson that he didn't see their split coming, but she wrote in&nbsp;Open Book&nbsp;that it was clear their relationship was suffering. In fact, they weren't even on speaking terms when she first expressed a desire to leave him.</p><p>“We had been together almost seven years when I told Nick, ‘I think I want a divorce.’ I later heard that he told the press he was blindsided. I don’t know how," she wrote. "At that point we were not even speaking to each other. Maybe he was just shocked that I stood up for myself. I don’t think he ever thought I would take the leap."</p><h2 id=jessica-s-secret-fling-with-justin-timberlake>Jessica's Secret Fling With Justin Timberlake</h2><p>While promoting&nbsp;Open Book&nbsp;on&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel Live!,&nbsp;Simpson revealed that shortly after divorcing Lachey, she had a very brief fling with Justin Timberlake, whom many pop fans deemed the 98 Degrees&nbsp;lead singer's&nbsp;musical rival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He was out of a relationship, he was, like, over at my house. We shared a nostalgic kiss," she admitted.</p><p>Their fling didn't last very long, however, because Timberlake ruined the moment by pulling out his phone and texting someone.</p><p>"I was like, ‘Okay, I hope that’s not, like, another girl. Like, did I, like, stick my tongue out too much or, you know? But apparently him and Ryan Gosling had a bet on who would kiss me first when they were 12-years-old. And so, he texted Ryan and said he won the bet."</p><p>That was a deal-breaker for Simpson, who immediately told the NSYNC singer, "Oh, okay. Um… so we don’t kiss again. That’s done."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Times Justin Timberlake Messed Up...
