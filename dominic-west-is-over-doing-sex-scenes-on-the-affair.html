The money, oh my God … Thank god they’re cute because otherwise you wouldn’t put up with it,”&nbsp;he told Us, laughing. Following the screening, West attended the Colette afterparty at&nbsp;Rainbow Room and guests enjoyed cocktails by Casa Noble Tequila.</p><p>Along with possibly being less sex, season 5 of The Affair will also include a major cast change: <a href=#><strong>Ruth Wilson</strong></a>’s Alison Bailey was killed during the season premiere.
