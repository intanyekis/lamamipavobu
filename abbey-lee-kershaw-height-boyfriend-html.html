After having won the competition, she began modeling and soon found herself opening and closing major runway shows all over the world. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Over the course of her modeling career, she has worked with many renowned&nbsp;photographers and brands. She has also graced the cover of magazines including Vogue, Flaunt, and Numéro.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Despite being one of the world’s most in-demand models, Lee moved away from modeling and transitioned into acting. She opened up&nbsp;about her decision when <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talking to The Guardian</a> back in 2015. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>You are so disposable as a model, there is no security in it and you don’t really believe people actually care about you. If I wasn’t a hot flavor anymore, I was going to lose work.</p><h2>Acting Career</h2><p>Lee made her acting debut as an actress in the George Miller directed post-apocalyptic 2015 movie Mad Max: Fury Road. After starring alongside Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, she played the part of Zoya Houbec, a model, in <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Ruben Guthrie.</p><p>Back when Ruben Guthrie just came out, Lee had revealed that she agreed to play Zoya because the character’s situation was very similar to her own, with both of them trying to navigate their life while taking a step towards a new direction.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Over the past six years, Lee has been dedicating more of her energy to acting and has been involved in 20 movies, TV&nbsp;shows, and projects. She made her theater debut by playing the role of Yeliena in the Hampstead Theatre’s 2018 London production of Uncle Vanya. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Most recently, the Mad Max: Fury Road actress’s major role was in HBO’s supernatural drama series Lovecraft Country. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her character, Christina Braithwhite, is an antagonist in the show and is&nbsp;described&nbsp;as the series’ equivalent to modern-day Karen. She also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> why she was drawn to her character.</p><p>I think I really wanted to tackle Christina because I didn’t understand her. And because she was so unhinged, and she was so ominous, and she was so scary, she was difficult and provocative. I wanted to get to the bones of that, try and understand her so I could be a part of this show, which is asking us all to look at some pretty big things.</p><h2>Does She Have A Boyfriend?</h2><p>Lee hasn’t been romantically linked with anyone in recent years and she is believed to be single. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She had previously dated Matthew Hutchinson and rumors of the two still being together circulated back in February 2016. The model-turned-actress, however, cleared up the misunderstanding, confirming she was single.</p><p>When <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speaking to Sunday Style magazine</a>, Lee shared she didn’t get picked up at bars.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She added&nbsp;it might be so because of her 5’11.5” (180 cm) height and her “resting *****” face. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lee was also previously rumored to be dating <a href=# rel=follow>Tom Cruise</a> in 2012 but both Lee and Cruise denied the dating rumors. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmSl7K6ecuenGajlafAqa3WZp%2BeoZedwW6uzrKdq6GVo7FvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
