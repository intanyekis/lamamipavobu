The images, shot by Mona Kuhn, show off the </span><i>Thor</i><span> actor’s chiseled abs, muscular legs and toned arms.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tom-hiddletston-3-5271638d-4dc7-4e9e-82b8-565589739164.jpg><p>Hiddleston jokes about why his derriere was edited out of his AMC TV series, <i>The Night Manager,</i> which debuted in April. “I was surprised to hear that they cut my butt out! I’m here to tell you that my butt is not dangerous,” he cheekily declared in the August issue. “And there are many, many more dangerous things that people are happy to broadcast. I don’t know what that says about the world we live in, but it probably says something.”</p><p><span>The steamy pics come on the heels of other photographs that caused a stir. Hiddleston was </span><a href=#>recently caught by cameras kissing and holding hands with <b>Taylor Swift</b></a><b></b><span> on a romantic stroll on the coast of Rhode Island on Tuesday, June 14.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tom-hiddletonston-2-0417f4e8-94b6-4713-8cfa-b1133988f4a7.jpg><p>“They were all over each other — hugging and kissing — even though there were 20 people coming and going on the beach,” an eyewitness told <i>The Sun</i>. “They looked like any young couple madly in love without a care in the world.”</p><p><span>At one point during the candid moment, Hiddleston chivalrously took off his navy jacket and put it on the “Wildest Dreams” singer’s shoulders. “Tom checks off a lot of boxes. He’s hot, smart, talented, British, blond, everything she’s into. What’s not to like?” a pal of the Grammy winner, who split from DJ </span><b>Calvin Harris</b><span> just weeks earlier, told <i>Us.</i> “She’s going with it, and why shouldn’t she? They have been bonding over the industry, their childhoods, where they are from. It’s the getting-to-know-you phase. Taylor is just happy to have the time to meet someone new and move on from Calvin.”</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><i>What do you think of Tom’s smoldering pics?</i></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6m8rnnHopudpJWowbC6jKKqZpqRqLakrculsGamkaCypXnIp2StoJmoerG0zq2mZqugp7KisIyapZ1lp5p6qLHTZqCtZaSWxq270Waua2lgaoRxew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
