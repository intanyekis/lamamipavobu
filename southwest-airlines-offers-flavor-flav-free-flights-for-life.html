After a debacle with Spirit Airlines, the competitor reached out to him to offer free flights – seemingly for life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this month, the rapper was trying to board a plane in Las Vegas when he got into a verbal disagreement with an airline agent.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Newly Divorced Tom Brady & Gisele Sued Over Crypto Endorsement</a></span></p><p>Flav explained he usually waits until most of other the passengers have boarded before doing so himself, as he likes to greet and take photos with fans. But when he tried to get on the flight in Vegas, he says the agent closed the door prematurely (and in front of him).</p><p>Spirit Airlines launched an investigation following the incident and decided to fully refund him for the flight.</p><p>Moreover, Spirit offered to <a href=#>update Flav’s flier status to “Gold,”</a> the airline’s highest tier. This gives him access to a variety of perks, including not having to pay for add-on charges (such as seat selection and baggage fees).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After hearing of the incident, Southwest Airlines decided to make Flav their own offer. Sources told <a href=#>TMZ</a> that the airline has offered him free flights for life; he can catch one whenever. They’ve reportedly also extended him a buddy pass, so he can travel with another guest for free.</p><p>A representative for Flav has said he’s received attention from other airlines since the incident, too, including Delta and American Airlines.</p><p>Though he keeps a relatively low profile nowadays, this wasn’t the first time Flav made headlines recently. In March, it was reported the entertainer is <a href=#>struggling to pay child support as well as legal fees</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Court documents revealed that Flav became a father for an 8th time when his former manager, Kate Gammell, gave birth to their son in 2019.</p><p>Shortly after, Flav agreed to pay Kate $3,000 a month in child support. However, he’s been struggling to make payments. The documents reveal he owes over $78,000 in backdated child support. He also owes his son’s mother $100,000 for legal fees.</p><p>Kate’s parents previously spoke to <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a> about their co-parenting situation. They claim Flav denied paternity for years until a DNA test proved otherwise. However, they say he’s been doing his best to get to know the child since discovering he’s the father.</p><p>The maternal grandparents also said they’re planning to change the child’s last name to Flav’s legal last name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>‘Donda West 2’ Producer Claims Kanye West Still Hasn’t Paid Him</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9KorK2gp5rAtXnAoqmloZ6awG67xZ%2Bcq6tdm7miws6rZJ%2Bkkat6p77EnmSfpJmctbW%2FjJ%2Bmq2WcnrOmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
