She was facing a potential life sentence for the death of her father, 64-year-old Konrad Imirowicz, whom she fatally injured by dumping lye powder on him while he slept, causing severe chemical burns.</p><p>Her father had to undergo amputation of both legs, as well as numerous medical procedures such as tracheotomy, skin grafts, and kidney dialysis. He survived for about five months before succumbing to his injuries. Imirowicz was found guilty in a trial and charged with using harmful irritants causing death.</p><p>The incident occurred after an argument between Imirowicz and her father, who was too intoxicated to take her to a hair salon appointment scheduled before her 18th birthday party. He was discovered by one of her friends and rushed to Ascension Genesys Hospital where he struggled with his drinking problem and arrived heavily intoxicated.</p><p>Imirowicz, sentenced to just over a year in jail with credit for time served, was granted release following her sentencing hearing. She was also placed on five years probation.</p><p>When interviewed by Court TV, Imirowicz expressed, “I was praying for a miracle today and that’s what I got. I’m really happy I get to go home with my family. I’m scared to feel anything about my dad right now. I miss him a lot. I’m not ready.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Teenager-freed-from-jail-after-fatally-dousing-father-with-chemical.jpeg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmirnp2elrSmvoyrnKWdkaiypXnFq6amZZmjsKK%2Bwp6pmqyZpLturcWtnKtllpbBorjLsmSdp6Wotq%2BzjJ%2BYraCVp3q4tdOhZJyglaK2pK3LZpurmZmjeqS4xJqlnqpdmcKmedOoZKGho2K2r8DOsaCcmaSevK97</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
