In fact, it doesn’t even feature any vocals from him. Instead, it’s “a stunning 87-minute mind-bender, minimalist and experimental, tribal and transcendent” that finds the reclusive rap icon showcasing his talents on a range of flutes.</p><p>There are no guest appearances from fellow Hip Hop heavyweights either, though jazz musicians such as Carlos Niño, Surya Botofasina, and Nate Mercereau have contributed to the tracklist.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/11/andre-3000-recalls-prince-pep-talk-after-horrible-outkast-show-250x142.jpg alt="André 3000 Recalls Pep Talk From Prince After ‘Horrible’ OutKast Show" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>André 3000 Recalls Pep Talk From Prince After ‘Horrible’ OutKast Show</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>November 17, 2023</p></a><p>As for Paul Wall, he’s been making headlines for <a class=underline-link href=#>his new, more distinguished look as of late</a>.</p><p>In a video posted to TikTok back in September, the Texas rap legend looked almost unrecognizable as he sported a full head of silver hair and a matching beard — a far cry from his buzz cut and soul patch that was seen in classic videos like “Still Tippin’” and “Sittin’ Sidewayz.”</p><p>Only his signature gold grill and thick Texas drawl remained.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“1st off, why my face look like the old man filter lol, we had a lot of fun yesterday, perfoming [sic] halftime with @Louie TheSinger and watching the @Houston Texans,” Paul captioned the clip.</p><p>“Mannnn gonna be a long journey but u can definitely feel we’re headed in the right direction @Tank Dell LFG homie!!!!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0minmq2cYsSiuMtmmKecopp6dHyPaWSfpKWpsm6ty5uspg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
