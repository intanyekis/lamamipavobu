What a good day.” The shirt features Andre in the jumpsuit he wore for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Outkast’s 2014 reunion tour</a>; the print on the shirt reads, “Across cultures, darker people suffer more. Why?”</p><p>To make the encounter even more&nbsp;heartwarming, Tiana wrote that Mr. Benjamin also took pictures of her posing in her shirt with his face on it.</p><p>“One of the most exciting parts about this moment was that he actually took two photos of me posing in the shirt,” she continued. “His energy was absolutely amazing though. I just wish I could explain the pause I took as he floated out of the damn coffee shop on this calm a** street lol.”</p><p>Gotta love a positive fan encounter with a positively pleasant person.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>walking down a silent block in Soho – Andre 3k (my mf hero) walks out of a coffee shop as I’m passing.</p><p>“Oh my God you’re on my shirt rn.” He was acting just as hype as me, which maximized my level of happiness/excitement x10000.
