The 59-year-old Amazon founder and 53-year-old journalist were seen vacationing once again on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jeff’s $500 million superyacht</a> and passionately smooching as they took in the beautiful coast of Italy on Thursday, July 27. In photos obtained by the Daily Mail that can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HERE</a>, the couple lovingly wrapped their arms around each other and kissed with joyful smiles in between.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jeff’s yacht was parked off of the picturesque island of Capri during their latest outing. The pair were dressed nicely in the pictures, with the billionaire in blue shorts and a white, short-sleeve collared shirt. Lauren wore a simple white sundress that screamed summer in Europe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-yacht-spl-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The couple, who reportedly<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> got engaged</a> earlier this year after five years of dating, hosted some A-list guests on Thursday that reportedly included <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oprah Winfrey</a></strong> and her bestie, CBS host <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gayle King</strong></a>. Many of the guests were also wearing white, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>including Oprah</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Before that, though, Jeff and Lauren stripped down to their swimsuits to fully enjoy the sunshine-filled day. Lauren showed off her phenomenal figure in a black string bikini, while Jeff had on a pair of short teal swim trunks that displayed his thigh muscles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-yacht-embed-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Lauren and Jeff have been spotted on the impressive yacht time and time again this summer. In June, Lauren was seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rocking a black bikini</a> on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two different occasions</a> as the yacht, called Koru, was parked off the coast of Europe. The happy couple were also seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>enjoying the celebrity hotspot town of &nbsp;Portofino, Italy </a>while giving their sea legs a break. Laurens’s kids<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> have been photographed</a> on the massive ship as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Lauren shares her kids, daughter&nbsp;<strong>Eleanor</strong>, 15, and son&nbsp;<strong>Evan</strong>, 16,&nbsp;with her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>former husband</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Patrick Whitesell</strong></a>. She met Jeff through Patrick several years ago. They finalized their divorce in Oct. 2019. And of course, Jeff was previously married to <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MacKenzie Scott</a>&nbsp;</strong>for 25 years. They announced&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their divorce</a> on Jan. 9, 2019 —&nbsp; the same day <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jeff and Lauren’s romance</a> was made public.
