Suspect Behavior, for instance, is a forgotten spin-off that was cancelled in a hurry.</p><p>Let's take a look back at the spin-off show that sank before it could develop into a hit series.</p><h2 id=39-criminal-minds-39-is-a-classic>'Criminal Minds' Is A Classic</h2><p>Thanks to being one of the most popular shows in modern history, Criminal Minds is a series that hardly needs an introduction. Simply put, the majority people have caught at least one episode of Criminal Minds, and many of them went on to watch plenty more thanks to the outstanding quality of the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 2005 until 2020, this show was a force on the small screen. Even when there were shifts made to the cast, fans tuned in regularly to what is easily considered one of the best police procedural crime dramas ever made. Many of the storylines managed to do original and inventive things, and the cast was brilliant in each episode. The show's primary leads had exceptional chemistry with one another, and they were the driving force behind the show.</p><p>In total, the series would air 15 seasons and a total of 324 episodes, making it a monumental achievement. Unbelievably, there are plenty of people out there who watched every single one of them, which demonstrates an incredible level of dedication. This was made possible because of the shows consistently great output.</p><p>Thanks to its success, Criminal Minds has gotten some spin-off shows</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Does A.J.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Series Finale</a>, "Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior follows a highly-trained team of agents who operate within the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). They use unique and hard-hitting tactics to bring down some of the country’s most dangerous felons. The TV series stars Forest Whitaker, Janeane Garofalo, Michael Kelly, Beau Garrett, Matt Ryan, and Kirsten Vangsness."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The premise of the show was promising, and the cast was loaded with talent. Because of this, there were high expectations set for the show.</p><p>As we have seen time and time again, it is exceptionally difficult for a spin-off show to catch on with audiences. Expectations are usually too high, sure, but the truth is that these projects usually are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unable to deliver the goods</a> when it matters most.</p><p>It wouldn't take all that long for audiences and critics to realize that Suspect Behavior was not going to be the next big hit for the Criminal Minds franchise. In just a short amount of time, it was off the air and completely forgotten about.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Criminal Minds': How Much Does Matthew Gray Gubler Make As Spencer Reid?</a></span></p><h2 id=it-flopped-and-disappeared>It Flopped And Disappeared</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After just a single season on the air, Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior was done and finished with. The network decided against bringing it back for a second season, and just like that, this spin-off went down in flames.</p><p>Not only was the series unable to be as captivating as its predecessor, but its ratings did it no favors. Couple this with the fact that other spin-offs were more successful, and you have a perfect formula for a quick cancellation.</p><p>"While spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles got off to an immediate great start back in 2009, the same can’t be said for CBS’ latest spin-off, Suspect Behavior. In February, it debuted to a 3.3 rating in the all-important 18-49 demographic and 13.06 million viewers. That was a solid start but then the second episode dropped 27% to a 2.4 rating and 9.8 million. By the fourth episode, it had fallen to a 2.2 demo rating," TV Series Finale reported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This had to stink for the cast and crew, who had put in a ton of work to get the project off the ground. Not only that, but being a failed spin-off is a distinction that no TV show wants to be tied to.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans On Twitter Just Revealed They Wanted This 'Big Bang' And 'Criminal Minds' Crossover</a></span></p><p>Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior is just another example of a spin-off show that was probably best left on paper.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'Criminal Minds' Actor Matthew Gray Gubler Might Be Single, But His Love Life Is Not Boring</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FRoqSippGheq61zZ2qZp6RnrmmsIysp6KmXaSzp3nSrqqpnZOpeqOxx5qtoqeiZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
