His age was calculated based on the fact that Zachary was 18 years old when he was arrested for a misdemeanor trespassing charge at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in 2018.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zachary-cruz-parents-%e2%80%93-is-he-adopted></span>Zachary Cruz Parents – Is He Adopted?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Zachary Cruz is the adopted child of Lynda and Roger Cruz.</p><p>Zachary Cruz was&nbsp;adopted&nbsp;at birth by the couple, who raised him in a loving environment.</p><p>As of, both his adoptive parents have passed away.

Apparently, he was being punished because of his older brother, who killed 17 people at the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Florida.</p><p>Although Zachary was arrested on March 19, 2018, he was later released from the Broward County Jail on a $500,000 bond. Reportedly, his attorney argued that the excessive bond showed Cruz was being punished for his brother’s actions. He also added that he has been punished for who he is related to, not because of anything that he did.</p><p>In addition, Zachary and Nikolas also have an older sister who is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence on charges including the second-degree attempted murder of a police officer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zachary-cruz-instagram-today></span>Zachary Cruz Instagram Today<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zachary Cruz does not seem to be active on Instagram as of today.</p><p>Not only Instagram, but he also does not seem to be active on any social media platforms.
