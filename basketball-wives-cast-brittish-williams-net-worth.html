Thanks to that change, fans have gotten the chance to watch several shows from the Basketball Wives franchise.Unlike a lot of reality series, the Basketball Wives shows have had a lot of people come and go over the years. As a result, fans have come to care about what is going on in a lot of people's lives including things like <a href=#>the truth about Tami Roman's weight loss</a>.While serious health issues like that are of paramount importance, the fact remains that shows like Basketball Wives largely focus on other aspects of the series cast's lives. A perfect example of that is there is a lot of interest in <a href=#>Shaunie O'Neal's relationship with Shaq</a>.Unfortunately for one of Basketball Wives' stars, there has been a lot of interest in her fortune in recent years. While fans are often interested in how much money celebrities have, the reality of Brittish Williams' financial situation is very worrisome for her and fans alike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-is-brittish-williams-worth>How Much Money Is Brittish Williams Worth?</h2><p>Even though Brittish Williams has starred in two seasons of the Basketball Wives franchise, she has never actually married a professional athlete. Instead, Williams was involved with the basketball power forward Lorenzo Gordon and the couple got engaged.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Basketball Wives: What Really Happened Between Evelyn Lozada And OG?</a></span></p><p>During Williams and Gordon's relationship, the couple ended up having a child together. Unfortunately, like a lot of other couples, Williams and Gordon went through some rough patches, and they ultimately wound up going their separate ways in 2019.</p><p>Before their split, Williams and Gordon starred in a season of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars together. On top of that, Williams has starred in 13 episodes of Basketball Wives and an additional 11 episodes of Basketball Wives LA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to all the money that Williams has made from reality TV as well as her other revenue streams, she has reportedly accumulated a healthy fortune for herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/draya-michele.jpg><p>Since Williams isn't as famous as someone like Draya Michele, publications like Forbes and celebritynetworth.com haven't reported on her net worth to date.</p><p>However, less credible websites like idolnetworth.com have reported that Williams currently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has a fortune that is worth between $450,000</a> and $1 million depending on the website. While those estimates definitely should be taken with a grain of salt, they give fans a ballpark idea of the kind of money that Williams likely has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-brittish-williams-in-serious-financial-trouble>Is Brittish Williams In Serious Financial Trouble?</h2><p>In January 2023, Todd and Julie Chrisley both began prison sentences that are set to last several years. The reason that the two reality stars went from showing off their riches on television to spending time behind bars is they were convicted of fraud and other charges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/todd-and-julie-chrisley-2.jpg><p>When other reality stars see the situation that the Chrisleys and Jen Shah now find themselves in, they likely want to make sure they never go through that. Unfortunately for Brittish Williams, she may find herself behind bars very soon.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What We Know About Real Housewives' Jen Shah's Prison Term</a></span></p><p>In October 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri put out a statement about Williams. Needless to say, that is the kind of thing that is almost always going to be bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As that press statement revealed, they were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">charging Williams with several serious crimes</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/todd-and-julie-chrisley-red-carpet.jpg><p>"Brittish “Cierrah” Williams had her initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Shirley P. Mensah. Williams was indicted on September 22, 2001 with five felony charges of misuse of a social security number, four charges of bank fraud, three charges of making false statements to the IRS, three charges of wire fraud, and three charges of aggravated identity theft."</p><p>After detailing the crimes that Williams was being charged with, the press statement went on to reveal what they allege that Brittish did wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"According to the Indictment, during 2017, Williams used false social security numbers in order to obtain a number of loans, lines of credit, and other funds from banks and financial institutions."</p><p>"Further, during 2018 and 2019, Williams deposited checks, without the knowledge and authority of the actual checking account holders, into several bank accounts she controlled and then withdrew the funds before those deposited checks were returned to the issuing banks for insufficient funds."</p><p>"The Indictment also alleges that Williams deposited fraudulent checks into bank accounts which she controlled and then withdrew those funds in cash before the fraudulent nature of the checks was discovered."</p><p>"Additionally, Williams is charged with submitting false information, including the names and social security numbers of individuals, to the IRS during tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019 falsely claiming that those individuals were her dependents on those submitted tax returns."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like a lot of other reality stars, there are a lot of <a href=#>people who don't like Williams</a>. However, if Williams is innocent of the charges she is facing, even her haters must feel bad for her. After all, she has spent months now knowing that a trial that currently is set to start in April 2023 will decide what kind of future she is facing.</p><p>Of course, if Williams is found guilty of the charges she is facing, she will almost certainly spend a lot of time in prison. However, there are other consequences she probably will have to deal with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Typically, when someone is found guilty of financial crimes, they have to pay massive fines. With that in mind, even if Williams is currently worth $1 million or more, there is a good possibility that her accounts will be wiped out.</p><p>On top of the fines Williams could be forced to pay, her ability to continue making a lot of money will also disappear. After all, it is extremely unlikely that Williams will be able to continue starring in reality shows like Basketball Wives from prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmqubmsGjrculZLChpprAbq%2FArKtmmqKewbW10qFksKGcobaiudJmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
