Us confirmed in August of that year that the Lost City of Z actor and the model <a href=#>had been “dating for months”</a> after knowing each other “for a long time.”</p><p>It wasn’t until April 2019 that Pattinson first addressed his relationship with Waterhouse. He told The Sunday Times that talking about his partner publicly and letting “people in … devalues what love is” for him.</p><p>Three years later, the couple made their first red carpet appearance together in December 2022 at the Dior pre-fall 2023 menswear show in Egypt.</p><p>Waterhouse proceeded to give fans insight into her relationship with Pattinson, telling <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sunday Times</a> in February, “I’m shocked that I’m so happy with someone for nearly five years. … I’m always incredibly excited when I see his name pop up [on my phone] or even a text, and I think he feels the same about me. We’ve always got so much to say, and I find him hilarious.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Pattinson and Waterhouse showed they were still happily in love while attending the <a href=#>2023 Met Gala in May</a>. As they walked the red carpet, the duo couldn’t stop smiling. They even shared a kiss, which sent fans into a tizzy.</p><p>That same month, <a href=#>a source exclusively told Us </a>that Pattinson is Waterhouse’s “greatest fan” and is “so happy for her success” after her Prime Video project, Daisy Jones & The Six, premiered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5Kav7V5z5qrraGeqLyvedKuoqJlp5bBpr7HqKysnV2drrexjJ2cn6GensGmuNhmm6Krk6rAtLHDZqSaqqKerqixjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
