The company used information taken from the CelebJets Twitter account, which uses public information to track the private jets of famous faces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Judge SHUTS DOWN Jamie Spears’ Request To Put Britney On The Stand</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-rsquo-s-jet-has-taken-170-flights-this-year>Taylor’s Jet Has Taken 170 Flights This Year</h2><p>The study revealed that Taylor’s jet had taken at least 170 flights since the start of the year (which equals 22,923 minutes in the air). With four months still left to go in 2022, this means Taylor’s jet was averaging 21 flights per month.</p><p>“<a href=#>Taylor’s jet has an average flight</a> time of just 80 minutes and an average of 139.36 miles per flight,” the study explained. It added that the emissions of Taylor’s jet are over 1,000 times the average person’s overall.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Emily Ratajkowski Silently Disses Husband After He’s Exposed For Cheating</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Her total flight emissions for the year come in at 8,293.54 tons, or 1,184.8 times more than the average person’s total annual emissions,” the study continued. “Taylor’s shortest recorded flight of 2022 was just 36 minutes, flying from Missouri to Nashville.”</p><h2 id=taylor-rsquo-s-team-says-she-rsquo-s-not-to-blame-for-the-flights>Taylor’s Team Says She’s Not To Blame For The Flights</h2><p>Though it may seem like Taylor is constantly in the air with her jet’s history, her team says this isn’t the case. The jet is often rented out to others, who make up a large portion of the trips.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“ <a href=#>Taylor’s jet is loaned out</a> regularly to other individuals,” a representative for Taylor told the media. “To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.”</p><h2 id=other-celebs-are-being-called-out-for-their-jet-usage>Other Celebs Are Being Called Out For Their Jet Usage</h2><p>Taylor has been the center of social media controversy as well as backlash from environmental activists and professionals since the study came out. But many celebrities have faced similar backlash recently. For example, Drake was blasted earlier this month <a href=#>for taking a 14-minute flight</a>, which would’ve only been an hour by car.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similarly, Kylie Jenner was branded a “climate criminal” after she <a href=#>used her jet to make a number of short flights</a>, including a 12-minute one. But even worse is billionaire Elon Musk. Though he claims to be pro-environment, the Tesla founder was exposed for taking a trip that was only 5 minutes.</p><p>While the general public is encouraged to go to great lengths to reduce their carbon footprint, the 1% appear to be getting away with a lot of environmental destruction. But it seems like the public is ready to hold them accountable.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Travis Barker’s Daughter Calls Cops To Break Up Mom’s Domestic Dispute</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>E!
