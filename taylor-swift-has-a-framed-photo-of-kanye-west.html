She has the ability to captivate audiences, has an army of fans ('Swifties') behind her, and has even broken multiple records with her music, <a href=#>including her latest Eras Tour</a>. Another thing that Taylor is also known for is her disses of other people, particularly when writing and recording her own songs. This might keep her motivated as she clearly does quite well from it.</p><p>However, one other method she definitely uses to stay motivated is to keep a framed photo of a standout point in her career in her home for her to look at every day to help motivate her to do better in her career (and it's clearly working).</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-thrives-thanks-to-maintaining-her-motivation>Taylor Swift Thrives Thanks To Maintaining Her Motivation</h2><p>It's very clear from the success that she's had in her career that whatever method Taylor uses to keep herself motivated is clearly working. She is known for having had many feuds with people, such as with <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> and <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a>, and using these as inspiration for songs to write.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/katy-perry-taylor-swift.jpg><p>One of her main feuds over the years was with Katy Perry after the two were on tour at the same time as each other and Katy had allegedly stolen some of Taylor's backup dancers for her own tour. It is even assumed that Taylor's song "Bad Blood" is about her feud with Katy, but this hasn't been confirmed.</p><p><a href=#>Katy seemingly tried to reignite the feud</a> at one point, which didn't work in her favor, but this is one of few feuds Taylor has had where the two are on good terms. Katy appeared in one of Taylor's music videos and Taylor even sent a present for Katy's daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor has even used her feud with Scooter Braun and Big Machine Records as a motivator for releasing her versions of her old songs/albums. <a href=#>These have been a particularly big hit with fans</a> and have only served to increase her popularity even more.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Declined To Comment About This Specific Ex-Boyfriend</a></span></p><p>What also cannot be forgotten is the fact that there is quite a large portion of her songs that she has written that are <a href=#>about people she has fallen out with</a>. This includes "Forever & Always" about Joe Jonas breaking up with her over the phone and "Out Of The Woods" about her relationship with Harry Styles.</p><p>Clearly, Taylor thrives off of using her life experiences as motivators for her work, and it's obviously working.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-has-a-framed-photo-of-kanye-west>Taylor Swift Has A Framed Photo Of Kanye West</h2><p>Not only does Taylor use writing songs about her feuds as a motivator, but she also likes to use a more visual form to motivate her to do well in life. This takes the form of having a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">framed photo of Kanye West in her house</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This sounds a little weird on its own, but there is a reason behind it. The photo is from when <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong> interrupted her at the MTV Awards and dissed her on-stage back in 2009, <a href=#>starting their ongoing feud</a>, which would last over a decade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kanye-west-taylor-swift.jpg><p>This might not have been the best point in Taylor's career, especially as she was still relatively new on the music scene at this point and was nowhere near as popular as she is now (although she was still pretty popular by this point), it could have made her question everything.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Wrote A Song About This Guy, But Then Ghosted Him When He Replied</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, it didn't, and Taylor came back even stronger after the slight from Kanye. Not only that, but the interaction gave her plenty of fodder for her music, which of course went on to earn plenty more awards.</p><p>But Taylor keeps that framed photo around, alongside photos of her with close friends like Emma Stone, Selena Gomez, and more. In that Vanity Fair interview, Taylor explained that she 'needs' to have photos of people she loves everywhere.</p><p>Yet the photo of herself on stage with Kanye has a different message, even if Taylor garners strength from it.</p><h2 id=taylor-will-never-forget-kanye-39-s-vma-diss>Taylor Will Never Forget Kanye's VMA Diss</h2><p>Not only will Taylor struggle to forget such a humiliating event, but it's doubtful that anyone watching the awards at the time or who has access to the internet has forgotten it either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift-smiling-and-bowing-in-concert.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst the awards are voted for by the public, Kanye clearly didn't agree with whom the public thought should win the best music video award that year, as despite it going to Taylor, Kanye thought that <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a> should get the award.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Unforgettable Stories Behind These Taylor Swift Songs And Who They're Written About</a></span></p><p>The situation even <a href=#>got a laugh from her then-boyfriend Taylor Lautner</a>. However, it did end up working out for the better for Taylor as when Beyoncé went up on stage to collect a different award, she got Taylor back up on stage to finish her speech that Kanye had interrupted.</p><p>These days, it's clear that while Taylor hasn't forgotten that moment, she's used it in a positive way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lmJbAbq2Mn6mapZWZerG0zq2mZqeWYriiutieZLCdo6l8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
