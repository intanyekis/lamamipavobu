The star has been teased by fans for the family-friendly and feline-based nature of her content, and her bio on the platform reads, "This is pretty much just a cat account".</p><p>Now, her most recent post has only added fuel to the fire and provided fans with more material to tease the 30-year-old songstress. In her new TikTok, Swift <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> a video of her cat Benji standing on the top of a couch, while Swift asks him if he thinks he's "the lion king". The clip's caption reads, "smol boi big dreams #catsoftiktok."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some fans love the singer's use of the popular internet slang term, others have found themselves cringing at Swift's choice of caption. One Twitter user wrote, "the thought that taylor swift herself typed 'smol boi big dreams' comforts me more than i thought it would", while another jokingly tweeted, "i forgot taylor was a millennial until i saw she said 'small boi'".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dave Grohl Says He's 'Scared' Of Taylor Swift After Re-Recordings Battle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of the Miss Americana star are also having a field day, contrasting Swift's use of slang in her latest video with the often elaborate language she employs in her songwriting. One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, "Taylor Swift: 'small boi', Also Taylor Swift: 'calamitous love and insurmountable grief'". And another tweeted, "TAYLOR freakin SWIFT saying a thing like 'small boi' while also having written songs like the lakes is actually reality-shattering".</p><p>Swift also made headlines today when she released the first single from the much-anticipated re-recording of her 2012 album, Red. "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)" hit music streaming platforms this morning, ahead of the full release of <a href=#>Red (Taylor's Version)</a> on November 19th.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Taylor Swift Doesn't Speak To Lorde Anymore</a></span></p><p>One Twitter user even suggested that Swift's much-talked-about TikTok of her cat foreshadowed the release of her new single today. They wrote, "taylor swift literally posted a tiktok yesterday asking benji if he thought he was the lion king, and captioned the video 'smol boi big DREAMS' as in wildest dreams. as in there's d*** lions in the wildest dreams music video".</p><p>Swift originally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a>Red (Taylor's Version) in an Instagram post way back in June of this year. She also revealed that her upcoming album would boast thirty tracks, including multiple unheard songs, "From The Vault".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Is What Really Went Down Between Taylor Swift And Scooter Braun</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkqeyorfSZquhnV2eu7Wx0aecrWWSrnq2v8innmaon6XCra3RZqqlmZ6cerS5zqVkm6eZYravedOioq2nm2KworzToqanZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
