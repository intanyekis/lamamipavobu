She explained this in her comments with the spoiler today. If you check, you are now able to get it. I check it out every day too, can’t wait for the next day.

I hate it when I am behind on the scoop and scandal!</p><p>Being new to these spoiler pages, I was appalled at her comments regarding her site problems. Especially the swearing and putting a fan down. I now know why she doesn"t have any advertisers or links. “This just in” is really old. There are far more spoilers at this site. Her excuse that it wouldn"t upload sounds like it was written by the Y&R writers. Why would you pay for a subscription that does not work. It seems that this has happened before. GO TO A FRIEND OR INTERNET CAFE!!! Are there any other good sites???</p><p>Quote <strong>winecountry</strong>: Being new to these spoiler pages, I was appalled at her comments regarding her site problems.

I was just wondering if anyone else had the same problem as me. I happen to like the site the same as I like this site.</p><p>How do you get to a Canadian site? Does she have more than one site? How does she get access to the scripts? Does she live in Canada??</p><p>Quote <strong>winecountry</strong>: How do you get to a Canadian site? Does she have more than one site?

Here is the link that I usually use but I cannot get it to work today. See if it works for you.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow ugc">www.young-restless.com/spoiler.html</a></p><p>Thank you.

What better place to ask why the spoiler page wasn’t working? The Toni MESSAGE BOARD, just as I suggested.</p><p>Send her a message about it being down and she gets defensive and insulting</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>LisaJ</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>August 23, 2008, 3:41am <span itemprop=position>17</span></span><p>Quote <strong>winecountry</strong>: Send her a message about it being down and she gets defensive and insulting</p><p>I think people email her demanding to know why she is not posting the day-ahead spoiler quicker. It’s not that the spoiler page is “down.” It’s not getting updated fast enough for people, apparently. I don’t blame her for being p!ssed. It’s HEr site, and she can update it as often as she wants to.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Linmat</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>February 6, 2015, 1:27pm <span itemprop=position>18</span></span><p>If you’ve never been to her site, there is no way you would know, in order to get to the message board, you have to get to the site first.
