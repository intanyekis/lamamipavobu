And now that the show has ended after 20 seasons, there is no doubting that they received a good return on their investment. It's not just their hit show that's making money. This family has transformed into a money-making machine <a href=#>thanks to their several businesses</a>, sponsorship deals, and paid appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some claim the Kardashians are wealthy just because they are well-known, but the reality is that Kylie Jenner, the youngest of the family, is one of the richest. The Kardashians are also noted for being intelligent and business savvy. The reality star's side jobs and personal companies have the potential to be quite lucrative. Here are the Kardashians' business ventures and their earnings.</p><p>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="A Look Inside Kourtney Kardashian’s $12 Million Palm Springs House" href=#>A Look Inside Kourtney Kardashian’s $12 Million Palm Springs House</a></p><h2 id=kendall-jenner-s-818-tequila>Kendall Jenner’s 818 Tequila</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendall Jenner is probably sibling who’s a late bloomer in terms of business. She founded the hand-crafted spirit brand called 818 Tequila in May 2021 and has had massive success since. The tequila brand has three variations namely Reposado, Blanco and Añejo. As of this writing, the net worth of Kendall’s brand is still not disclosed to the public however her estimated net worth is $45 million. Each bottle of tequila costs around $59.99 and shipped millions of bottles since it started trading in the U.S. The Daily Mail even reported that the Kendall’s spirit brand is the number one latest tequila brand in the market.</p><h2 id=khlo-kardashian-s-good-american>Khloé Kardashian’s Good American</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the Australian News website, the value of <a href=#>on and off girlfriend of Tristan</a> Thompson's&nbsp;American denim line Good American, which she co-founded with Emma Grede, who also serves as the company's CEO, is roughly $12. 7 million. According to an interview Grede gave WWD, despite receiving terrible news due to many unfavorable reviews on the employment transparency website Glassdoor, the all-inclusive business has still experienced phenomenal development. The company sold 136,000 cases or 1.5 million bottles in the first seven months. Its success has been compared to George Clooney's billion-dollar Casamigos tequila empire. The product has faced criticism, though, with claims of "copying," a fraudulent claim of origin, and trademark infringement from rival brand 512 Tequila, just like most Kardashians.</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-s-poosh>Kourtney Kardashian’s Poosh</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Net Worth Spot estimates Kourtney Poosh's worth at $15 million based on its social media accounts and current sales, although other people believe it is worth much more. According to the website, Poosh aims to educate, inspire, create, and curate a contemporary lifestyle accessible to everyone. Poosh is a lifestyle brand in addition to a cosmetics brand. That implies that her brand will encompass the tea set, the shelves' colognes, and even the towels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=kris-jenner-s-jenner-communications>Kris Jenner’s Jenner Communications</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It would be impolite to omit the minds behind the Hollywood family's reality success, especially given that <a href=#>the famous&nbsp; Kardashian mother</a> is estimated to be worth a staggering US$190 million by Newsweek. The precise nature of Jenner Communications' work is still unknown, and one writer for Betches even referred to it as a private firm. It is significantly less well-known than her daughters' endeavors. According to its LinkedIn page, the performing arts business was established in 2007 and has less than 10 employees.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner-s-kylie-cosmetics-and-kylie-skin>Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Cosmetics And&nbsp;Kylie Skin</h2><p>The family member with the most brands at the moment is Kylie Jenner. Though it may not have the financial success of her cosmetics line, her skincare line, which promotes vegan, gluten-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and dermatologist-tested products, is at least doing reasonably well for itself. According to Net Worth Spot, Kylie Skin is roughly $16 million. Although Kylie Swim and Kylie Baby, two of her other companies, are now unvalued, they have cult followings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Kylie Cosmetics was first introduced in 2015, the youngest family member immediately rose to the top ranks of the Kardashian-Jenner clan's most successful business people. When it comes to promoting things, especially cosmetics, Jenner's viral Instagram account, which presently has 352 million followers, has always been a powerful tool. <a href=#>The company's Lip Kits</a>, for example, sold out almost immediately after she posted about them. She made headlines in 2020 when she famously sold Coty 51% of her shares for a cool $540 million before taxes. She presently controls roughly 44%. Despite Forbes' accusations that she had inflated her wealth, the magazine still pegs it at a hefty $600 million.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-s-skims-and-skkn>Kim Kardashian’s Skims and Skkn</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before ceasing operations in 2021, it was known as KKW Beauty and KKW Fragrance. At the time, it promised to relaunch the items alongside major global beauty brand Coty. Business Insider estimates that it was worth $1 billion before its redesign. 2020 saw Kardashian sell 20% of the business to Coty for $200 million. Although the company's exact valuation following its makeover is unknown, based on its forerunner's popularity, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kardashian will probably do extremely well</a> out of it. However, those with exceptionally long memories will recall that Skkn is still quite different from Kim's initial entry into the cosmetics industry, the somewhat subpar Kardashian Beauty line in 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After launching the business in 2019, the 41-year-old has seen the company go from strength to strength, cementing its own billionaire status since late 2021. Kim Kardashian has been successful as an entrepreneur, largely thanks to <a href=#>her shapewear brand Skims</a>, which recently doubled in value and is now worth a whopping $3.2 billion. Among the highlights of Kim's business career so far have been that Skims managed to overtake its main rival Spanx, and when the company collaborated with Fendi, its products sold out within 60 seconds. Skims also partnered with Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics to design an exclusive range for the country's athletes. There was also that much-talked-about Victoria's Secret supermodel campaign featuring Tyra Banks, Alessandra Ambrosio, Candice Swanepoel, and Heidi Klum. Needless to say, we can only see Kim's flagship brand getting bigger and bigger.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Inside The Lavish Life Of True Thompson, Daughter Of Khloe Kardashian" href=#>Inside The Lavish Life Of True Thompson, Daughter Of Khloe Kardashian</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harpers Bazaar</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SCMP</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMpJirnJGotaqtzWahnqaemr%2B0edahpmadkae7bsDHnmSmp6Opeqe%2BzqZkraCVnr9uu9anZJuto567pr%2FSZq2epqSqv6a%2FjKuYp6OVmXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
