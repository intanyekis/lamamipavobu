Fresh off of three-straight losses, the Jets will take the field as double-digit home underdogs.

The game will air on Prime Video.</p><p><strong>News and notes for Jets vs. Dolphins</strong></p><ul><li aria-level=1>All eyes are on the QB situation for the Jets. Coach Robert Saleh benched <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NMsbhTzlCqTO76ld href=#>Zach Wilson</a> and will start journeyman <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ppfYs4UKzV66qcLD href=#>Tim Boyle</a>. This move comes after Saleh replaced Wilson with Boyle late in the third quarter of last week’s 32-6 loss to the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=34 href=#>Bills</a>. Boyle is 0-3 as a starter across his five seasons in the league, with all of those occurring in 2021 when he was with the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=41 href=#>Lions</a>. Boyle has thrown three touchdown passes and nine picks in 18 total games in his career. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ABg22RaQHam6KtKB href=#>Trevor Siemian</a> will serve as Boyle’s backup with Wilson demoted to QB3, at least for now.</li><li aria-level=1>For all of the vitriol directed toward Wilson, the running game must bear some blame for the Jets’ offensive ineptitude. In the team’s four wins, the offense has averaged 138.2 rushing yards per game. That number is almost cut in half in the six losses, dropping to 74.2.</li><li aria-level=1>On the other side, Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa is currently second in the league in both passer rating (106.0) and touchdowns (21), and he’s third in yards (2,934). He has at least one touchdown pass in every game this season and has thrown multiple interceptions once. It also helps that Tagovailoa has been sacked 15 times in 10 games. Wilson has been sacked that many times in just his last three contests.</li><li aria-level=1>Dolphins WR <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9f4ZZkppMneXJAFj href=#>Tyreek Hill</a> has 1,222 receiving yards in 10 games, putting him on pace for 2,077, which would set a new single-season record. Calvin Johnson holds the mark with 1,964 in 2012 (16 games). The Jets have generated 1,995 receiving yards as a team for the season.</li><li aria-level=1>The Dolphins have won five of the past six meetings and hold a slim 58-56-1 advantage in the all-time series (including playoffs) against the Jets.</li><li><a href=#><span>Follow live coverage of today’s Black Friday NFL Game, Dolphins vs. Jets</span></a></li></ul><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Jets' coaches and GM still have job security, all because of Aaron Rodgers</p></a><p>All&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">odds from BetMGM</a>.
