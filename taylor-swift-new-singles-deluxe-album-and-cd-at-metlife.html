Ice Spice: </strong>When the clock strikes midnight on Friday, May 26, Taylor will release a brand spanking new version of her hit “Karma” from 2022’s “Midnights” featuring the iconic Ice Spice. “She is THE ONE to watch,” Swift promised when she announced the collab on <a href=#>Instagram</a> with a space-themed photo of the two.</li><li><strong>Snow on the Beach feat. Lana Del Rey (Pt. 2): </strong>The highly requested re-do is happening! Fans were thrilled when “Midnights” featured Taylor’s longtime friend, Lana Del Rey. Despite the excitement, fans still felt Lana’s voice was too low to truly be heard in the song. So, naturally being the mastermind that she is, Taylor and Lana went back into the studio to bring fans a<a href=#> re-recorded version</a> featuring more Lana. This remix will also be released on Friday, May 26 at midnight.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Midnights (Til Dawn Edition) deluxe album</strong>: Just when it seems Swift couldn’t possibly have more music up her sleeve, she does. Because of course. If the new collaborations weren’t already enough to have fans spiraling, news dropped that those two songs —&nbsp;as well as an unreleased track — will be on Taylor’s<a href=#> “Midnights (Til Dawn Edition) deluxe album</a>,” certainly will. That’s right, the album now includes three sections: “Midnight,” “3am” and “Til Dawn.”</li><li><strong>Special Edition CD</strong>: <strong>ALERT!!!</strong> if you are going to the East Rutherford shows you are among the lucky Taylor fans who will have the chance to purchase a special edition, limited edition, in person only CD. The singer added this little tidbit at the end of her lengthy list of surprises noting that the disc will include a “Midnights” vault track called “You’re Losing Me.”&nbsp;</li><p>Plus, if you’re going to a show at MetLife, you just might bump into new Jets quarterback <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Rodgers</a> who confirmed he’ll “for sure” be there to see Swift perform on his now home turf.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taylor Swift 2023 tour schedule</h2><p>At the rate Ms. Swift releases new content, Swifties will always have something to look forward to.</p><p>Want to see what gets incorporated into shows?</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Secure your ‘Eras Tour’ tickets for all remaining concerts on the run here</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taylor Swift opening acts</h2><p>This weekend, Taylor is bringing Phoebe Bridgers, Gracie Abrams Gayle and Owenn with her on select dates of the three-night residency.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about the established openers.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Phoebe Bridgers</a></strong>, 28, is a headliner in her own right.
