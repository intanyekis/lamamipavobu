It's all a part of the process. U know me well enough 2know I would document the process if I got a surrogate.Everyone's body is different,every pregnancy is very different I've learned to love my body at every stage! I'm going to get even bigger & that's beautiful too! I'm blessed to even be pregnant! & luckier to not have preeclampsia so far, so I don't have the swelling issue! They also say your body carries a boy different than a girl I'm grateful to God for this miracle & no matter what rumors or comments you throw my way this time they truly don't affect me!”</p><p>In the image, Kardashian angles her body to flash her famous booty, covering her breasts with her right arm.</p><p>It is reminiscent of the nude pregnancy shoot Kardashian’s older sister, <strong>Kourtney</strong>, did for DuJour Magazine in late 2014, when she was pregnant with her third child, son Reign.
