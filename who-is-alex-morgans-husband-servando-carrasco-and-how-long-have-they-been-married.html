While he was born in the United States, it was in Tijuana, a city in Baja California, Mexico, that he spent most of his early childhood.</p><p>At the age of seven, his family relocated back to the United States where the footballer attended a private Catholic high school, St. Augustine High School located in the North Park district of San Diego, California.&nbsp;Like most athletes, Carrasco’s career dates back to his high school days when he played for his school’s team and also for a prominent youth club in California, the San Diego Surf Soccer Club.</p><p>For people around him, it was apparent that Servando would become a professional footballer at that stage as he was exceptional in the sport; so much that he was honored as the San Diego Union-Tribune All-County Player of the Year, CIF Player of the Year, and Western League Player of the Year among other recognition.</p><p>It is said that he participated in the Premier Development Program and Olympic Development Program before he moved on to the University of California, Berkeley on scholarship where he had his college career with the Chicago Golden Bears from 2007 to 2010.</p><h2><strong>He Currently Plays as a Defensive Midfielder for The Fort Lauderdale In USL League One</strong></h2><p>Servando Carrasco had a successful college career with the Golden Bears. In the four years he played with the team, he appeared in a total of 73 games and found the net 13 times, seven in his last season. This earned him an honorable mention spot on Pac-10 All-Academic in addition to other recognition like Third Team Pac-10 All American, First Team All-Pac-10, and NSCAA Third Team Far West Region.</p><p>In January 2011, at the year’s MLS SuperDraft, the Seattle Sounders FC drafted him in the second round as the 27th overall selection and it marked the beginning of his professional career.&nbsp;He played for the side until 2013 scoring once in a total of 40 appearances. On the 13th of September 2013, he was traded to the Houston Dynamo and he played for them until the following in a total of 19 appearances with no goal.</p><p>At the 2015 MLS SuperDraft, the Dynamos traded him to Sporting Kansas City for the 30th pick and he played only nine games for the side with no goal.&nbsp;Also in 2015, he was traded to Orlando City in exchange for another midfielder. Servando played for the side until the end of the 2017 season: he played 58 games and scored once. The defensive midfielder had to enter the 2017 MLS Re-Entry Draft after Orlando City failed to extend his contract.</p><p>With that, he was selected by the LA Galaxy and he played 35 games for them with no goal. Again, the side didn’t extend his contract, forcing the player to go where he is wanted; he signed with Fort Lauderdale CF, which competes in USL League One in 2020. Unlike his wife, Servando Carrasco has not had the opportunity to represent the United States on the international stage.</p><h2><strong>Alex Morgan and Servando Carrasco Met At UC Berkeley Where They Both Represented The School’s Teams From 2007 to 2010</strong></h2><p>As stated earlier, Servando Carrasco played for the California Golden Bears men’s soccer team for four years from 2007 to 2010. In the same time frame, his wife played for the Golden Bears women’s soccer team and it was what brought the two together. While how they fell in love is a story yet to be told, it is known that they began dating in college. When they were both ready to make their professional debut, it threatened to pull them apart.</p><p>In January when Servando was drafted to play for the Seattle Sounders FC based in Seattle, Washington City, Alex was drafted to play in the Women’s Professional Soccer league by the Western New York Flash, a team based in Elma, New York. They didn’t let the long-distance get in the way of their love; so they continued dating while pursuing their career on the opposite end of the country. In December 2013, when they got together, Servando proposed to Alex and they started planning for their wedding.</p><h2><strong>They Got Married On New Year’s Eve of 2014 and Are Now Parents to a Daughter Named Charlie Elena Carrasco</strong></h2><p>A year after Servando Carrasco asked Alex Morgan to become his wife, they walked down the aisle and officially became life partners.
