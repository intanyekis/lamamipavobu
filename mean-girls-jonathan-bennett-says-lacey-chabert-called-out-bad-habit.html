One time, Lacey Chabert called me back and told me I had to start saying goodbye and that I couldn’t just hang up anymore.”</p><p>Since starring in <a href=#>Mean Girls</a> in 2004, Bennett and Chabert, 41, have each headlined and produced <a href=#>several Hallmark movies</a>; they even reunited in the network’s 2010 film Elevator Girl.</p><p>Bennett’s next <a href=#>Hallmark holiday flick</a> will be Christmas on Cherry Lane, which follows three couples at crucial turning points in their lives as parents. One couple is about to welcome their first child and another finds their family unexpectedly expanding while the third duo starts a new chapter as empty nesters. Christmas on Cherry Lane premieres on Hallmark Channel Saturday, December 9, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll down to learn 25 things fans might not know about Bennett:</p><p>1.

I’ve never actually read a book all the way through.</p><p>3. Instead of asking my dad to build a treehouse [when I was a kid], I asked for a stage to be built in my basement with a working red curtain and a spotlight. He actually did it.</p><p>4.

I never kicked a soccer ball until I had to on set for Mean Girls.</p><p>7. Pine Sol is my favorite scent.</p><p>8. I grew up flying airplanes with my dad. I don’t have a license, but I’ve been able to take off and land a plane since I was 10.</p><p>9. Meeting a Broadway diva, especially Elphaba from Wicked, makes me more nervous than anything in the world. I break out in hives.</p><p>10. I never say goodbye on the phone; I just hang up because I’m done with the conversation.
