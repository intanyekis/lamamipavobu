The pair actually met at the Ozark premiere, interestingly enough, and it's Ozark that has earned Pelphrey his most recent kudos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His character really touched fans, even though his run on the series has since come to an end; Pelphrey portrayed Ben Davis for two years. The actor has since moved on to other projects, but fans are still talking about his performance on Ozark, and the conversations it has sparked since.</p><h2 id=tom-pelphrey-39-s-ozark-character-couldn-39-t-last>Tom Pelphrey's Ozark Character Couldn't Last</h2><p>Like other actors, Tom Pelphrey joined a popular series when it was already a few seasons in. Ozark's third season featured Ben Davis' debut, and an impressive performance by Tom Pelphrey.</p><p>The character of Ben works as a substitute teacher but is fired after troubles at work. Tom's character is mentally ill, dealing with bipolar disorder and the fallout of the medication he has to take.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why There Won't Be An 'Ozark' Season 5">Why There Won't Be An 'Ozark' Season 5</a></span></p><p>Of course, Ben Davis throws a wrench in things by letting details slip about the notorious Navarro cartel. His slip-up results in the silencing of Davis; Pelphrey's final episode shows him postmortem.</p><p>Though Ben didn't survive past the fourth season of the show, viewers were impacted by Tom's acting abilities, taking to every comment section to praise him for his efforts.</p><h2 id=fans-thought-pelphrey-deserved-an-emmy-nomination-for-ozark>Fans Thought Pelphrey Deserved An Emmy Nomination For Ozark</h2><p>While praise for Tom Pelphrey can be found just about everywhere, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one Reddit thread dives into the specifics</a>. Fans wrote that Tom's acting was phenomenal and that he "deserves a lot of credit."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because his portrayal of the character involved acting out both manic and depressive episodes, viewers were quick to admire Tom's ability to act realistically.</p><p>One wrote, "I thought his portrayal of someone with bipolar disorder in a manic state was amazing." Others agreed, complimenting both the fact that Ozark got it right when it comes to bipolar disorder and the fact that Pelphrey executed the performance so flawlessly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Think This Is The Worst Character On 'Ozark'">Fans Think This Is The Worst Character On 'Ozark'</a></span></p><p>The writers were part of the equation, as fans noted, "[bipolar disorder] a lot less predictable than writers like to show and Ozark did a great job." Another fan commented, "His character was so well written and he absolutely acted the hell out of the role."</p><p>At the time, commenters were bummed that Pelphrey hadn't yet earned an Emmy award.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that conversation, though, he was later nominated for a handful of awards, including a Primetime Emmy and a Screen Actors Guild Award, among others.</p><p>Fans seem to think he deserved even more, though. At least, most of them did.</p><h2 id=not-everyone-was-thrilled-with-pelphrey-39-s-performance>Not Everyone Was Thrilled With Pelphrey's Performance</h2><p>Responses to Ozark's handling of bipolar disorder were largely positive, but there were pockets of dissent despite Pelphrey's much-praised performance.</p><p>Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelphrey explained the depth of his research on bipolar disorder</a> in preparation for the role, not everyone thought he nailed it.</p><p>Some online commenters who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned whether his interpretation of bipolar disorder was realistic</a> received a variety of responses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One commenter on Quora pointed out that shows like Homeland and Ozark tend to "show the person with bipolar disorder in its most heightened state to contribute to the interest level, shock value, and appeal to [audiences]."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="8 Celebrities Who Prioritized Their Mental Health Over Their Careers ">8 Celebrities Who Prioritized Their Mental Health Over Their Careers</a></span></p><p>That commenter also alluded to the fact that people consume content featuring people with pronounced, severe mental health issues almost as a form of voyeurism.</p><p>In the same vein, they wrote, "The TV screen is bipolarâ€™s magnifying glass," suggesting that there are tamer sides to bipolar disorder that Ozark didn't care enough to show.</p><p>Of course, the fact that the show sparked such conversations is likely a positive overall, though viewers are somewhat divided on the appropriateness of the delivery.</p><h2 id=what-is-tom-pelphrey-working-on-now>What Is Tom Pelphrey Working On Now?</h2><p>Since wrapping Ozark, Tom Pelphrey has been busy. <a href=#>He did start dating Kaley Cuoco around May 2022</a>, but his professional life has been full, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor appeared on Outer Range as Perry Abbot, is slated to appear in the miniseries Love and Death, and worked on another miniseries that doesn't yet have a release date.</p><p>In addition to TV shows, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelphrey's been working on two films</a> in 2022; American Murderer and She Said, both of which are said to be released in 2022.</p><p>There's no word on what he'll be doing next, since none of his current projects are long-term ones, but Tom Pelphrey has already cemented his reputation as an actor, so he'll have no shortage of work in the coming years (whether or not he and Kaley Cuoco stick together).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddmbaledOopGaolaG9qb7EsmSppJGueqq6jKixmqqbZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
