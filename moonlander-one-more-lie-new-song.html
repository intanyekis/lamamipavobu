With a sun-kissed production that seems to blend classic R&B with a thumping hip-hop beat, MoonLander bemoans the betrayal of trust and tells his untrustworthy love that she will “go to the grave with your lies / but the rock with your name / will not be by me.” It’s a harsh rebuttal, but as the 24-year-old shares with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, the song comes from some genuine hurt.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3></p><a style=color:#ccc;text-decoration:none title=MoonLander href=# rel="noopener nofollow">MoonLander</a> · <a style=color:#ccc;text-decoration:none title="One More Lie" href=# rel="noopener nofollow">One More Lie</a><p id=content-paragraph-4>“ ‘One More Lie’ is a song I wrote about my ex-girlfriend who would just lie over and over again, even about the smallest things,” MoonLander shares with <strong>HollywoodLife. </strong>“I really loved her, so time after time, I would get hurt and forgive her, but it got to the point where I had to just say this person isn’t changing and I can’t be with her anymore. I even showed her this song, and she still continued to lie, but I got a great song that is honestly one of my favorites just because it’s so real.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Moonlander-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fans have been connecting with that realness since MoonLander first began his music career. Like many, he started in school, rapping at the young age of 13 and developing his skills while growing up in Charlotte. In 2019, he hit the road for the first time, doing a quick tour with <strong>Mike Studd</strong>, and a 23-city tour with <strong>Kidd Quill</strong>. He also expanded his fanbase with opening spots for acts like <strong>Machine Gun Kelly, Wiz Khalifa</strong>, and the late <strong>Juice WRLD</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Moonlander-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>He’s been quite prolific in a short time. He has three full-length projects under his belt – Honey Bunny, Houston97, and the H97 Files, the latter two released in 2020 – and a whole mess of singles, including “I Hate This Song,” “BRIGHTSIDE,” and “Good Night.” 2020 may have slowed some artists down, but clearly, MoonLander used the lockdown to fire a rocket and shoot his career to the next level. He also says he’s got an album on the way, and fans can experience what he has planned in person at the Breakaway Music Festival and the Blended Festival. He’ll also partner with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cool Cat Wine Spritzer</a> to support&nbsp;<strong>Bryce Vine </strong>during his late summer tour, taking place over the next few weeks.
