We all love each other.”</p><p>During a table read for the final season of Fuller House, the Masked Singer alum teared up talking about how much he loved reuniting with Sweetin, 39, Bure, 45, and <a href=#><strong>Andrea Barber</strong></a>, who played D.J. Tanner’s best friend, Kimmy Gibbler.</p><p>“I’m so proud to have been able to raise these girls and know them since they were … like my girls — like my own daughters,” he said in May 2019. “I couldn’t be prouder if I was your own dad. And I love you.”</p><p>The Olsen twins, 35, didn’t participate in Fuller House, but <a href=#>they also stayed close with their TV father</a> after leaving behind their acting careers. When Saget appeared on Broadway in the play Hand to God in November 15, <a href=#>Ashley proudly supported him on opening night</a>, posing for photos with him backstage. That same month, the Row designer had dinner with the Philadelphia native in New York City.</p><p>The Temple University grad was also close to <a href=#><strong>John Stamos</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Dave Coulier</strong></a>, who played Danny Tanner’s brother-in-law and best friend, respectively. In January 2019, Saget and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Kelly Rizzo</strong></a>, went on a double date with the Scream Queens veteran, 58, and his spouse, <a href=#><strong>Caitlin McHugh</strong></a>.</p><p>“What can you say about someone you’ve loved for so long and want to spend the rest of your life with?” Saget joked via Instagram at the time, sharing a photo of the foursome seated together at dinner. “But enough about @JohnStamos — We are both so lucky to have married these wonderful beautiful women @eattravelrock and @caitlinskybound — And we know which we are married to…whew.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The characters Saget, Stamos, and Coulier, 62, played on Full House and its sequel series weren’t related by blood, but in real life, they referred to each other as siblings. “I’ll never let go, brother,” <a href=#>Coulier wrote via Instagram</a> on Monday, January 10, after Saget’s death. “Love you.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see what the Full House cast has said about Saget over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNks7a4y2afqK2jmnqkrdKtqmappaTBpr%2BMmpmoraRir7CujKyYoJ2kYsGpvs6unqFlpJ2ybsXEmqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
