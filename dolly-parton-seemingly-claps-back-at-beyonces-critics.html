Another social media user added, “She talking to some of y’all. Read the room!!!” while another wrote, “Dolly said do we have a problem?”</p><p>While Cowboy Carter has received plenty of praise from fans and critics, other <a href=#>observers have tried to say</a> Beyoncé has no place dabbling in country music after years of working in pop and R&B. <strong>John Schneider</strong>, who last year came under fire for saying President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> should be “publicly hung” in a since-deleted X post, compared Beyoncé’s country foray to a dog marking its territory.</p><p>“They’ve got to make their mark, just like a dog in a dog walk park,” Schneider, 63, said during a February interview with One America News Network after Beyoncé released the album’s first two singles. “You know, every dog has to mark every tree, right? So that’s what’s going on here.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Schneider may not appreciate Beyoncé’s new country sound, Parton does — and has <a href=#>defended the Grammy winner’s</a> right to make whatever music she chooses. “I’m a big fan of Beyoncé and very excited that she’s done a country album,” <a href=#>Parton wrote via Instagram</a> in February after “Texas Hold ’Em” topped the chart. “So congratulations on your Billboard Hot Country number one single. Can’t wait to hear the full album!”</p><p>After Beyoncé dropped the whole album, including her “Jolene” cover, Parton shared her appreciation for the new take on the song. “Wow, I just heard ‘Jolene,’” Parton wrote via Instagram on Friday. “Beyoncé is giving that girl some trouble and she deserves it! Love, Dolly P.”</p><p>Back in 2022, Parton told <strong>Trevor Noah</strong> that she’d long wanted Beyoncé to cover “Jolene,” which Parton originally recorded in 1973. “I don’t know if she’s even got the message, but wouldn’t that be killer?” Parton said during an interview on The Daily Show. “I would just love to hear ‘Jolene’ done in just a big way, kind of like how <strong>Whitney [Houston]</strong> did my ‘I Will Always Love You.’ Just someone that can take my little songs and make them powerhouses.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuopJyuerGt0a2mp2WjmrKutc2go7Jlk6Gusb%2BMm5ico12WwW6uxLKmp5uVqHqkvsitoJyrXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
