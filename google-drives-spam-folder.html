Within the spam folder, users can choose to delete the files, move them to a different folder, or report them to Google for further analysis. This level of control ensures that users have the final say in managing their Drive content.</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>The new spam filters and spam folder represent a significant enhancement to Google Drive‚Äôs security measures.
