Her lawyer filed court papers in 2013 under her governorship and argued that South Carolina should not have to recognize same-gender marriages performed legally in states because it could be contrary to the Tenth Amendment and the state‚Äôs sovereign interests.</p><p>During her rebuttal to President Barack Obama‚Äôs last State of the Union Address in 2016, she said republicans could respect the differences in modern families. As a cornerstone of our democracy, we would also demand respect for religious liberty.</p><p>Nikki Haley also supports Florida‚Äôs <strong>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say G*y‚Äù</strong> bill and believes it does not go far enough because she thinks acknowledging the presence of LGBTQ people is the same as talking about s*xual intercourse.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Haley about trans children in sports</h2><p>She opposes transgender children and youth participating in <a href=#>sports</a> in February 2021.
