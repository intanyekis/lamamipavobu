Much like other movie adaptations based on author <a href=#><strong>Nicholas Sparks</strong></a>’ catalog of novels,&nbsp;<i>A Walk to Remember&nbsp;</i>charmed viewers with its sweet love story between Jamie Sullivan (<a href=#><strong>Mandy Moore</strong></a>) and Landon Carter (<a href=#>S<strong>hane West</strong></a>).</p><p class=p1>“[It’s] bananas,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>This Is Us</a>&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>exclusively gushed about the film 16 years after its initial 2002 debut</a> in January 2018. “It [makes] me feel really old! It’s crazy. It feels like another lifetime ago. But I’m so happy to celebrate it and so happy that people still — it’s relevant and still means something to people. That means a lot.”</p><p class=p1>The “Candy” songstress even admitted to&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>at the time that she hadn’t <a href=#>rewatched the film in nearly ten years</a>, though still <a href=#>remembered her fond memories</a> on set.</p><p class=p1>“I had no idea what I was doing. Every time I had seen it, which is not very often, I just think like, ‘Aw, that little girl had no idea what she was doing,’” she recalled to&nbsp;<i>Us.</i>&nbsp;“I remember <a href=#>Shane had to teach me how to hit the mark</a>. I didn’t know anything. He was like, ‘No, no, no. You gotta come here.’ I knew nothing.”</p><p class=p1>Moore played high school student Jamie <a href=#>in the romantic drama</a>, which hit theaters in January 2002. As Jamie embraced her mortality amid a difficult leukemia battle, she soon crossed paths with bad boy Landon when he must join her in the school play to make up for past mischievous actions. As <a href=#>the two teens fell in love on screen</a>, faithful viewers were immediately captivated by Moore and West’s connection as they brought the two literary characters to life.</p><p class=p1>“We all had chemistry offscreen, in the sense of bonding and in friendship, including [Mandy Moore], which is the funniest thing because all the other characters had been bullying her. Everyone liked each other,” the<i>&nbsp;Nikita</i>&nbsp;alum <a href=#>explained&nbsp;in a June 2021 interview with&nbsp;Vulture</a>. “It was the opposite of the movie. Everyone got along and had a great time. And yeah, there was chemistry. I think we [Mandy and I] both had a little bit of a crush, but then we were just there for each other in the most honest and purest of ways. That sounds incredibly corny but is true and rare.”</p><p class=p1>Though it has been years since the pair’s costarring debut, they’ve <a href=#>continued to gush about their movie bond</a> and their film experience.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Welp.
