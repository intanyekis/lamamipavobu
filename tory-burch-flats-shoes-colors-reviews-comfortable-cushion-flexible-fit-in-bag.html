It should be considered up there with taking the SAT, walking a tightrope or recreating Houdini’s deathly illusions. The problem with a lot of flats is that they take their name too seriously, not offering any cushioning or support, or they dig into the tops of our feet, clinging on for dear life. Even when they actually do manage to be comfortable, they’re often ugly as sin, to put it bluntly. That’s why when we find a pair that offers comfort, style and a designer name attached to it, we need to let it be known!</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tory Burch Minnie Travel Ballet Flat</a> is our favorite flat right now, for sure. They have hundreds of incredible reviews, and shoppers are calling them “soft as butter.” One even said that these are the most comfortable Tory Burch flats they own! Another called them both “gorgeous” and “comfortable,” noting that these two qualities make for “the perfect combination” in footwear. The best part? As one shopper reported, these Minnie flats will leave us with “no blisters!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tory-Burch-Minnies-Tan.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tory Burch Minnie Travel Ballet Flat</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$205</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>These flats were designed to be a timeless classic that’s “never out of style.” They have a smooth leather upper with a round toe, featuring Tory Burch’s iconic circular double-T logo plaque on top. This medallion-like logo matches the color or pattern of the shoe’s upper in some cases, while in others it shines, coated with a metallic gold!</p><p>Back at the heel, we’ll find a soft and stretchy section so we won’t have to suffer through handfuls of painful wears until our shoes are finally broken in. They come essentially broken in already! They also have a smooth leather lining on the inside, upping the comfort factor. This contributes to the “slipper-life feel” of the flats. Note that we said “feel,” not “look!” These flats look like anything but loungewear, but they’re still comfy enough to wear inside. We won’t be begging to kick them off like we do with other shoes at the end of the day.</p><p>Upping the comfort factor even more is the lightly-padded, embossed footbed, providing cushioning. We want to wear our flats as all-day shoes, so we love that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these Minnies</a> were actually made for feet! Too many shoe brands forget that that’s what footwear is truly about, first and foremost.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tory-Burch-Minnies-Gold.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tory Burch Minnie Travel Ballet Flat</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$205</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p>These flats also have a slip-resistant, split-rubber sole for traversing through rough terrain. That rough terrain is probably just going to be the mall or our office most of the time, but still. The absolute best part of this sole is that it’s so flexible that it can fold completely in half! This means we can store the flats in our tote bag or shoulder bag. We often tend to wear <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> on our commute into work and change into cuter shoes once we reach our desk, and with these flats, we won’t need to carry a whole extra bag in order to do so!</p><p>These flats are currently available in eight colors. For a pair of totally black flats that we can hopefully wear forever, check out the Black version. Remember how we said the logo plaque differs from shoe to shoe? In this Black version, it matches the upper, but there’s also a Black/Gold version that lets the logo shine in all of its metallic glory!</p><p>If we want to throw just a little color into it, we can also check out Ink Navy/Gold. Is the gold plaque not cutting it? Make sure to check out Spark Gold, which is all gold everything! This flat really dresses things up and would be perfect for a night out when we’re not in the mood for heels. Though, with these flats on our shoe rack, we can’t say we’ll be in the mood for heels very often.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tory-Burch-Minnies-Tortoise.jpg><p>Looking for something more neutral for everyday wear? Go for Goan Sand, a versatile beige, or Light Oak, which takes on a more peachy tint. Both of these shades feature a matching matte logo plaque.</p><p>The last two shades are Royal Tan/Gold, which is a light brown shoe with a gold-toned plaque, and Tortoise. Tortoise takes things in a new direction, as the upper is actually a shiny patent leather with a reddish-brown and black tortoiseshell pattern! The logo plaque actually carries this pattern as well, making for a totally unique shoe. (P.S., this version is on sale!)</p><p>We believe everyone should have their own pair of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these Minnie ballet flats</a>. At least one pair, we should say. Maybe getting every single color is an excessive indulgence, but guess what? We like it that way.</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tory Burch Minnie Travel Ballet Flat</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$205</a> at Zappos!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?
