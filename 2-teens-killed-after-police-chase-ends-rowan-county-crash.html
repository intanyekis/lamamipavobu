It ran off the right side of the road, flipped, and hit the pole.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Authorities said the driver, 18-year-old Austin Ryan Davis, and the passenger, 16-year-old Aiden Daniel Humphries, both from Huntersville, died at the scene.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Channel 9′s Almiya White could still see debris and personal items scattered across the ground near the scene of the crash. She spent most of the day Friday working to learn what led to the crash.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Mooresville police told Channel 9 the chase began when they clocked the truck driving 75 miles per hour on Oakridge Farm Highway, which has a speed limit of 45 miles per hour. Police said they tried to pull the truck over but it left the scene, driving onto Highway 801.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Police said officers could see alcoholic drink cans being thrown out of the truck and onto Highway 801, so they believed they and other drivers were in danger. The same type of cans were found at the crash scene, police said.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Investigators in Mooresville said the crash happened when Davis lost control of the car.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">A friend of Davis’ asked not to show their face, but did want us to know what kind of person he was.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“What I’m going to miss the most about Austin is that he always had a smile on his face 24/7. He never once had a dull moment,” Davis’ friend said. “He always had a good laughter with jokes and things like that. He could walk into a room and make everyone die laughing.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Several friends and loved ones have created a makeshift memorial to remember the two teens.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Police believe alcohol is part of what caused the crash. Troopers said the crash is still under investigation.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><i>This is a developing story.
