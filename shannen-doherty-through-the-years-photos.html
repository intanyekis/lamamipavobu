Her career took her from navigating one of <a href=#>TV’s most memorable love triangles</a> to casting spells to reviving some of her beloved roles decades later.</p><p>The actress was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in April 1971. She got her start as a child star on&nbsp;Little House on the Prairie&nbsp;and went on to appear in the dark comedy&nbsp;Heathers.</p><p>Doherty’s fame continued to grow after she earned the part of Brenda Walsh on&nbsp;<a href=#>Beverly Hills, 90210</a>. After departing the series, she joined the cast of&nbsp;<a href=#>Charmed</a>, portraying Prue Halliwell.</p><p>In the midst of her professional success, the&nbsp;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&nbsp;star tied the knot three times. She was married to <strong>Ashley Hamilton</strong> from 1993 to 1994 and <strong>Rick Salomon</strong> in 2002. She ultimately wed <strong>Kurt Iswarienko</strong> in 2011.</p><p>Doherty received sad news in 2015 when she was <a href=#>diagnosed with breast cancer</a>. She announced she was <a href=#>in remission</a> in 2017 but revealed in 2020 that the <a href=#>illness had returned</a>.</p><p>Despite her diagnosis, the&nbsp;Our House&nbsp;alum returned to film the revival&nbsp;<a href=#>BH90210</a>. “I was hesitant for all different reasons — where I was at [in] my life [and] being <a href=#>unsure if I wanted to revisit&nbsp;90210</a>,” she explained to&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in August 2019. “I didn’t want to be the reboot queen. I had already done&nbsp;Heathers, which was very important to me.”</p><p>However, former costar <a href=#>Luke Perry</a>’s sudden death in March 2019 following a stroke gave her a purpose. “They were always going to, with or without me,” she acknowledged. “It came back around at a time where I thought it was the right time to do it, to honor a friend and be with my friends, recreating something that was special to America, special to the world and most importantly, special to all of us.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The revival also gave cast members — including <a href=#><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></a> — the opportunity to set the record straight on past headlines about Doherty. “She <a href=#>had an unfair rap</a>. She took it and took it like a champ,” the actress told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in September 2019. “Once they gave her that label, it lived with her, her whole career, and that’s unfortunate. … It just wasn’t true. … We were all really good friends.”</p><p>Scroll to revisit Doherty’s career, personal life and health struggles through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKmtzaecp2WUpLWmvtOyZK2goqTCqLSMrZ%2BeZamarrO%2FjKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
