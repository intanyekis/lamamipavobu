The supermodel, 25, took to Instagram on Monday morning to post behind-the-scenes clips from her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>maternity shoot</a> at 33 weeks pregnant. “Making-of,” Gigi wrote with a smiley face in the caption of her post. The videos included a slew of different looks: two clips of the model in white and green sheer dresses, and another of Gigi in unbuttoned jeans and a ribbed white tank top.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Gigi first shared photos from her maternity shoot to Instagram on August 26. The black and white portraits, which were taken by&nbsp;photography duo, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Luigi and</a></strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Iango</strong></a>, revealed her bare baby bump under a sheer dress. Although Gigi’s a seasoned pro when it comes to posing for the camera, she revealed that the maternity shoot wasn’t her easiest one.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I loved it, I knew what I wanted from the pics and Gab and L&I really made it happen for me.&nbsp;But was definitely more tiring than working normally,” Gigi <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>replied</a> to a fan who inquired about behind-the-scenes details from the shoot on Twitter. “Got through the second look and was like ‘guys I think I can only do two more’ hahaaaa,” the model explained. Fatigue is quite common in pregnant women, especially during the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>third trimester</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gigi-hadid-bare-bump-fan-zayn-malik-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Gigi <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirmed she’s expecting</a> her first child with the former <strong>One Direction</strong> singer&nbsp;during an appearance on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon on April 30 — four months after the couple rekindled their on-again, off-again romance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms, but we’re very excited and happy and grateful for everyone’s well wishes and support,” Gigi told Fallon in reference to pregnancy reports that circulated right before she appeared on the late night talk show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The expectant couple has been quarantining together&nbsp;at her mother <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Yolanda Hadid</strong></a>‘s farm in Pennsylvania. Gigi celebrated her 25th birthday at the end of April and shared a collection of photos with her boyfriend and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family</a>, including sister <strong>Bella Hadid</strong>, who spent a portion of quarantine with the couple. Residing in PA during the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed Gigi to enjoy her pregnancy in private — something she’s admittedly “cherished.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Both Gigi and Zayn are thrilled to become <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first-time parents</a>. “Zayn is nervously excited to be a dad,” a source close to the singer told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, exclusively. “He is very eager to see what the unknown will bring.” A second insider shared that the young couple “is&nbsp;incredibly excited.” — “They’re&nbsp;in&nbsp;their&nbsp;place&nbsp;in&nbsp;[in&nbsp;NYC]&nbsp;now, everything is&nbsp;ready&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;baby,&nbsp;and they&nbsp;are&nbsp;just waiting&nbsp;for&nbsp;the big day,” the source said, adding, “It’s a very special and exciting time, and they&nbsp;couldn’t&nbsp;be&nbsp;more&nbsp;in&nbsp;love.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Gigi and Zayn began dating in 2015 and announced that they had split for the first time in March 2018. They later reunited, and broke up again in January 2019. Gigi went on to have a brief fling with Bachelorette alum <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tyler Cameron</strong></a>, who was spotted with the model at her grandmother’s funeral in the Netherlands in September 2019. Gigi and Zayn got back together for good in January.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e5JqZqChl556qa3DoptmpZGpsrO6yK2wZquYpLy1edWim56no2Kvoq7YZpmupaBivbOxxqeYp5upYr2pu9Ooqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
