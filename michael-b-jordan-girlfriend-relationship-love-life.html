In their defense, there certainly are a lot of great things that celebrity actors get to enjoy. For example, virtually everyone would love to receive their paycheques, and attending star-studded events seems extremely glamorous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though the masses tend to focus on how great famous people have it, there also are several aspects of celebrity that are pretty hard to stomach. Of course, the fact that so few people become famous makes it pretty hard to relate to the negative aspects of fame.</p><p>Among the biggest acting stars of his generation, Michael B. Jordan has been famous for many years at this point and given how talented he is, that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon. Of course, Micahel B. Jordan has to be overjoyed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has made so much money as an actor</a>. However, it is pretty notable that Jordan keeps certain aspects of modern celebrity life at arm’s length including the fact that he is very private about his love life. That begs an obvious question, why does Michael B. Jordan not talk about his girlfriends?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic Tweet Shows Michael B. Jordan Knows How To Clapback</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=acting-superstar>Acting Superstar</h2><p>A former child star, Michael B. Jordan first garnered a lot of attention when he played Wallace from HBO’s The Wire. Going on to star in the Friday Night Lights TV show for several years, Jordan also appeared in 59 episodes of All My Children from 2003 until 2006.</p><p>Eventually able to make the leap to movie stardom, Michael B. Jordan’s spectacular performance in Fruitvale Station took his career to a whole new level. Since then, Jordan has become a staple of huge movies like the Creed films and Black Panther among others. In fact, Michael B. Jordan’s career has become so interesting that fans love to learn all they can about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his most notable roles</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael B Jordan To Included Inclusion Riders For His Production Company</a></span></p><h2 id=constant-conjecture>Constant Conjecture</h2><p>On top of the fact that Michael B. Jordan is an incredibly accomplished actor despite his young age, there are a lot of other reasons to like the man. For example, you’d have to be blind to not realize that Jordan is an extremely good looking guy and he comes across as a delightful fellow during his public appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the way a lot of people seem to obsess over Michael B. Jordan, it isn’t surprising that people are very interested in his personal life. However, a lot of the time things can get pretty silly. For example, after Michael B. Jordan starred in a steamy music video with the Swedish singer Snoh Aalegra, loads of people suggested that meant they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">likely were a couple</a>. There also are loads of people that can’t get enough of the chemistry that Michael B. Jordan and Lupita Nyong'o share, which is understandable since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they are awesome together</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Times Michael B. Jordan Sent Our Hearts Aflutter</a></span></p><h2 id=very-valid-reasons>Very Valid Reasons</h2><p>Whenever Michael B. Jordan talks about how it feels to be famous, it seems very obvious that he has a love and hate relationship with stardom. For example, when Jordan was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asked about his heartthrob status</a> during an interview with USA Today, he said it was “something to get used to”. Obviously, that speaks to the fact that he doesn’t necessarily love all of the attention. Of course, he also has a sense of humor about it all as he paid to replace a youngster’s retainer after she broke it when she clenched her jaw while watching him in Black Panther.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Willing to talk about his love life in general, Michael B. Jordan addressed the current state of that aspect of his life during a 2018 interview with GQ. "My career is awesome. It is going great. There's other places in my life that I'm f*cking lacking at," he continued. "I'm very mature and advanced in a lot of areas of life. Dating may not be one of 'em. My personal life is not. I don't really know what dating is."</p><p>During that same 2018 interview, Michael B. Jordan also addressed why he keeps the details of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his dating life so secret</a>. “But it's like, I could meet you, right now, boom, right here. Me and you sitting here chilling, whatever. Meal, whatever. Somebody could be over there, see this. And all of a sudden, you're my girl now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuing on, Michael B. Jordan went on to address how things change once the media have linked him to a potential mate. “So then they're going to talk about you, they're going to find out who you are. They're gonna find out what your Instagram is, they're going to find us in that. And all the fan club and everybody else is going to find out who you are, and now you and I are forever associated with one another. So now, how do you go anywhere normal, chill, just getting to know somebody that you just met, that you may not—may or may not—hit it off at all? That part of dating is tough.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A 17-Year-Old Broke Her Retainer and Michael B.
