It was widely believed that <a href=#><strong>Jason Momoa</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lisa “Lilakoi” Bonet</strong></a> married in November 2007, but they didn’t make it official until this October, multiple sources confirm exclusively to Us Weekly.</p><p>“Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet had an official wedding a few weeks ago at their house in Topanga, California,” one insider reveals. “Apparently they weren’t officially married until then! They said they ‘made it official.'”</p><p>A second source confirms to Us that the couple — who share kids Lola, 10, and Nakoa-Wolf, 8 — purchased a marriage license from the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk’s office on October 2, one week before they exchanged vows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jason-momoa-lisa-bonet.jpg><p>Bonet’s daughter <a href=#><strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong></a>, whom she shares with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong></a>, attended the wedding, as did <a href=#><strong>Alicia Vikander</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Michael Fassbender</strong></a>, famed rock climber <strong>Chris Sharma</strong> and several of Momoa’s former costars. “He stays close with the people he works with on movies and is a really nice guy,” the first source tells Us. “It was a big party and people came from out of town to attend.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to a Facebook user who saw a friend’s photos from the wedding, the Game of Thrones alum, 38, wore an unbuttoned white shirt and a lei. He styled his long locks into a man bun. The Cosby Show alum, 49, “looked beautiful,” according to the Facebook user’s pal, who said some of the guests performed a traditional Māori haka for the bride.</p><p>The couple first met through mutual friends in 2005. Momoa previously revealed that he had a crush on Bonet after watching her on The Cosby Show as a child. “The first time [we met] I was like, ‘I want that one. I want her. I’m going to get her,'” he told <a href=#><strong>Katie Couric</strong></a> in 2014. “I didn’t tell her until after we had our two children. But I told her … ‘I kind of stalked you. I was going to find you.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaOku265zqammmWcnsCiecGopZ6sXaSzp7XCopilpKliuqK%2B0bJkoqZdqLKkvsStZLCdlJm2r7OO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
