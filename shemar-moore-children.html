Moore — who plays Hondo — had previously starred as Malcom Winters on <a href=# rel=noopener>The Young and the Restless</a> from 1994 to 2005 and as Derek Morgan on CBS’ Criminal Minds from 2005 to 2016 before taking his the lead role in S.W.A.T.&nbsp;</p><p>Hondo and his love interest, Nichelle Carmichael, start dating in Season 3 after they meet helping an injured man following a pursuit of armed robbery suspects. Michelle reveals that she’s pregnant with her and Hondo’s first child in Season 5. They welcome their daughter, Vivian Carmichael Harrelson, in Season 6 — two months after Moore’s girlfriend gave birth to their <a href=# rel=noopener>first child in real life</a>.</p><p>Moore, who has dated celebrities like Halle Berry and Toni Braxton, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">BET</a> in 2013 about why starting a family wasn’t a priority for him at the time. “It’s no accident that I’m not married and don’t have kids yet. Because despite what I’ve achieved in my career, I’m always wondering when somebody’s gonna tap me on the shoulder and say, ‘OK, the gig is up,'” he said. “I don’t mind being uncomfortable. In fact, I like being uncomfortable, picking up and moving, and all that. But, it’s not exactly the best scenario for a family. Of course, I want to be able to share that with somebody one day. When I do tie the knot, it will be one time, for good.”</p><p>That all changed a decade later when Moore welcomed his first child.&nbsp;Read on for what to know about <a href=# rel=noopener>Shemar Moore’s child</a> and family, and how his daughter honors his late mother.</p><p>How many children does Shemar Moore have?
