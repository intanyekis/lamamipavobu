Just when we thought we’d seen our queens for the final time after their seasons ended, we remember that we have social media. Social media has been connecting us to our favorite queens for quite some time with varying forms of content. YouTube might be the one platform that allows for viewers to truly connect and see a new side of their favorite queens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>YouTube has been a popular site for quite some time, so it comes as no surprise that some of our favorite RPDR queens have their own successful, thriving channels. Who doesn't want to watch the charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent of some of these queens on their very own YouTube channels? Without further ado, let’s take a look at eight of the queens from RPDR that have top notch YouTube channels.</p><h2 id=bob-the-drag-queen><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bob The Drag Queen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Our Season 8 winner Bob The Drag Queen is <a href=#>one of the various queens slaying</a> the YouTube space. While many fans usually catch Bob working with best friend and drag sister Monét X Change, YouTube is a space where Bob is able to truly shine on her own. Bob’s YouTube channel is full of everything that her “Bobble Heads” could ever want to watch: RPDR reviews (also known as “Purse First Impressions”), makeup videos, vlogs, <a href=#>music videos</a>, and more. Bob truly is so talented at everything she puts her mind to, and the charisma shines through in every video posted. It’s safe to say you’ll be more than satisfied when watching her YouTube channel.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Queens From RuPaul's Drag Race Started Their Own Podcasts</a></span></p><h2 id=trixie-mattel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Trixie Mattel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Truly, <a href=#>many fans of Trixie Mattel</a>’s could say that they first discovered her on YouTube, so of course she has her own individual channel.
