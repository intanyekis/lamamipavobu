Coolidge pursued her dreams of becoming a serious actress like Meryl Streep and Glenn Close. She attended Emerson University and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. However, it was there that she found her true calling as a comedic actress. As we have seen in quite a few roles, nobody does it quite like Coolidge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Jennifer Coolidge Claims Her Life Would Have Been Boring In The 2000s Without Her American Pie Cameo</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Coolidge's game changing role came in the film American Pie</a>, where she played Stifler's mom opposite Seann William Scott. She then went on to reprise her character in both the sequel in 2001 and American Wedding in 2003 before making a return nearly 10 years later for American Reunion. Those roles alone, you might think, increased Jennifer Coolidge's net worth quite a bit. So let's break it down for you. Here is what we know about Jennifer Coolidge's salaries for her biggest movies and TV roles.</p><h2 id=what-did-jennifer-coolidge-get-paid-for-american-pie>What Did Jennifer Coolidge Get Paid For American Pie?</h2><p>Jennifer Coolidge started acting in 1993, with a memorable role in Seinfeld. She then went on to make her film acting debut in the 1995 movie A Bucket of Blood, which was followed by her small roles in Plump Fiction and A Night at the Roxbury. The big wow hit, though, when Jennifer landed that major role playing Stifler's mom in American Pie. According to Celebrity Net Worth, each of the supporting actors, including Jennifer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earned somewhere between $500,000 and $750,000 for their work on the movie.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jennifer-coolidge-stifflers-mom.jpg><p>Celebrity Net Worth also reported that the film was a huge hit and earned over $235 million globally. This helped boost Jennifer's career immensely and made it nearly impossible for her not to move on with the franchise. The sequels American Pie 2 and American Wedding, were also extremely successful at the box office. In total, the four movies have grossed nearly $1 billion.</p><h2 id=how-the-white-lotus-affected-jennifer-coolidge-39-s-net-worth>How TheWhite Lotus Affected Jennifer Coolidge's Net Worth</h2><p>Here's where it gets tricky. From what is known of Jennifer Coolidge's net worth, she ranks in at $6 million. However, it is not known what she made for White Lotus. What we do know, is that the part was specifically written for her, and she wasn't even considering going back to work at that point due to depression during COVID and not feeling ready.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jennifer-coolidge-as-tanya-in-the-white-lotus.jpg><p>Cosmopolitan states, Mike White had a strong drive and determination to enlist Coolidge, though, and it is evident from this statement: “When you get to work with Mike White, and he’s going to deliver something at $3 million an episode, he gets to call the shots.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Jennifer Coolidge Was 'Very Disappointed' After Learning Her White Lotus Character's Fate</a></span></p><p>If Jennifer Coolidge made anything near $3 million an episode, her net worth far exceeds $6 million. She was in every episode of season one and season two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-ariana-grande-had-jennifer-coolidge-in-her-39-thank-you-next-39-music-video>Why Ariana Grande Had Jennifer Coolidge In Her 'Thank You, Next' Music Video</h2><p>Well, it turns out that Jennifer Coolidge contacted Ariana Grande through direct messages which resulted in her cameo in the music video for "Thank You, Next" with Kris Jenner. During an interview on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Jennifer revealed that it all happened during a time when she felt like nothing was going on for her anymore, it was just a dead zone, she felt somewhat hopeless. Then Ariana Grande did an impersonation of her on Jimmy's show, and it revived her!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ariana-grande-and-jennifer-coolidge.jpg><p>Coolidge was encouraged by a friend to DM her, however, she thought it was pointless due to her massive following. She decided to take a chance, though, and send the message anyway. To her surprise, Ariana responded and invited her over to her house to get fitted for wardrobe for the music video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>Here's How Ariana Grande Revitalized Jennifer Coolidge's Career</a></span></p><p>According to an Entertainment Weekly interview in 2018, music videos director Hannah Lux Davis revealed that Jennifer improvised some of her dialogue and had great chemistry with Ariana on set. Hannah also commented on how Jennifer looked just like her character Paulette from Legally Blonde and hadn't aged a day. Although it's unclear how much Jennifer was paid for the appearance, the video has garnered over 745 million views, so it was definitely worth something.</p><h2 id=jennifer-coolidge-has-over-100-acting-credits>Jennifer Coolidge Has Over 100 Acting Credits</h2><p>Jennifer Coolidge's career began in 1993, when she secured her first role as Jodi on Seinfeld. Since then, the actress has showcased her talent in a variety of films, including Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, 2 Broke Girls, Zoolander, Nip/Tuck, Sex and the City, and A Cinderella Story. Despite having made her name as a comedy actress, Coolidge has expanded her range and taken on more dramatic roles, such as those seen in Promising Young Woman and The Watcher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jennifer-coolidge-a-cinderella-story.jpg><p>With over 100 acting credits under her belt, many of which were blockbuster hits, we can assume that the star made a sizable sum of money from her acting career. Considering she has homes in Hollywood, New Orleans, Boston, and New York all fully furnished to the hilt, yea, she’s got it going on.</p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-jennifer-coolidge>What's Next For Jennifer Coolidge?</h2><p>Jennifer Coolidge considers herself fortunate to have had the opportunity to work in such stunning locations, especially considering the challenges of filming during the pandemic. Following her time in Hawaii for The White Lotus, she stayed with fellow cast members like Lenny Kravitz and Sônia Braga in the Dominican Republic while shooting Shotgun Wedding. In the film, Coolidge portrays Jennifer Lopez's mother-in-law, and although she is excited about her son's impending nuptials, things quickly take a turn for the worse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jennifer-coolidge-and-josh-duhamel-in-shotgun-wedding-via-youtube-prime-video-channel.jpg><p>While finishing up with Shotgun Wedding Jennifer started preparing to appear in the Netflix comedy We Have a Ghost. Fans are also eagerly anticipating a possible Legally Blonde 3 movie, but Coolidge insists she has not yet seen the script that Mindy Kahling supposedly wrote. In addition to these projects, she is hoping to collaborate with talented female filmmakers in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoycpqikmZm0pnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal50pqjmqqpYrqwwsieqmaZnZq%2Fqq%2FAp2SpoZVisKq6w56pnqSclnq0wM6rsGaZop6ur62MoKmappSaerW0xGauoaGkmnqtu9Ouqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
