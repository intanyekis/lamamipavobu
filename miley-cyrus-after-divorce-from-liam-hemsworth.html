Fans were completely blindsided by the split. Since they had just tied the knot, many were under the impression that these two were going to spend the rest of their lives together, particularly since they had already shared an eight-year, on-off relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After their split, there was gossip that Miley was wasting no time moving on from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hunger Games</a> star. In fact, she was spotted making out with Brody Jenner's ex-wife, Kaitlynn Carter. Sources claimed that Miley and Kaitlynn were seeing one another, but their relationship didn't last long. Cyrus would soon fall head over heels in love with the blonde Aussie hunk, Cody Simpson, before announcing her plans to drop a seventh studio album sometime in 2020.</p><p>What else has Miley been up to since calling it quits Liam Hemsworth? Here's what you need to know.</p><h2 id=she-signed-a-new-management-deal><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>She Signed A New Management Deal</span></h2><p>In February 2020, it was revealed that Miley Cyrus had parted ways with her longtime management company, CAA, to sign with William Morris Endeavor Entertainment instead. The timing seems perfect since Miley is finalizing her seventh studio album. Her new management team will be there to help when she drops the new record.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-dated-brody-jenner-s-ex-kaitlynn-carter><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She Dated Brody Jenner’s Ex Kaitlynn Carter</span></h2><p>Following her split with Liam during the summer of 2019, Miley wasted no time starting a new relationship - this time, it was with a woman named Kaitlynn Carter, whom&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was seen kissing</a> while on vacation in Italy. Carter had just ended her marriage with Brody Jenner, so she could relate to what Miley was going through. Their relationship was in full swing for a couple of weeks before they decided to call it quits.</p><h2 id=she-released-a-song-about-her-marriage-downfall><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She Released A Song About Her Marriage Downfall</span></h2><p>After calling it quits with Liam, Miley went on to release an emotional ballad titled, "Slide Away". In the song's lyrics, she talks about a relationship that has run its course. While she never revealed whether the track was about her marriage, it seemed pretty obvious, given all of the clues in the song, along with the fact that she released it in the wake of their split.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprising Things Other Stars Have Said About Miley Cyrus (Good And Bad)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-started-dating-another-aussie><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Started Dating Another Aussie</span></h2><p>Miley Cyrus clearly wasn’t wasting any time after her relationship with Liam ended - just weeks after her romance with Kaitlynn had reportedly ended, she was seen getting cozy with Australian singer, Cody Simpson.

In April 2020, the former Hannah Montana star shocked fans when she was seeing shaving her boyfriend’s head in an Instagram video posted on Simpson’s page. Apparently, he’d been wanting to sport a new look for some time, and since getting a professional haircut amid the global pandemic was impossible, Miley played hairdresser.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-collaborated-with-ariana-grande-and-lana-del-rey><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Collaborated With Ariana Grande And Lana Del Rey</span></h2><p>In September 2019, Miley joined forces with Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey for the ultimate collaboration. They collaborated on the song, ‘Don’t Call Me Angel.’ The track was lifted from the poorly-received Charlie’s Angel’s reboot, and though the film bombed at the box office, fans were obsessed with ‘DCMA’ and its visually appealing music video. The song went on to peak at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><h2 id=she-dispelled-engagement-rumors-with-cody><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Dispelled Engagement Rumors With Cody</span></h2><p>Just weeks after going public with Cody Simpson, Miley was seen sporting what appeared to be an engagement ring, leaving fans wondering whether she was honestly looking to tie the knot again - especially since it hadn’t even been more than six months since she announced her divorce from Liam. However, it turned out that the ring Miley was sporting on her wedding finger was actually just a piece of jewelry owned by Cody. She liked it enough to wear it on a day out.
