Now the girl is back and is trying to accuse Kim of cheating on her ex-boyfriend <a title="Reggie Bush Net Worth" href=#>Reggie Bush</a>&nbsp;during the course of their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maya tweeted a picture of a check with a disclosed amount of money she got from Kim’s lawyer convincing her to speak out against Kris during the trial of their divorce. Kris and Kim married in 2011 for an estimated amount of $10 million before they filed for a divorce, with their marriage lasting only 72 days.</p><p>She followed with a series of tweet rants saying that Kim cheated on Reggie with <a title="Kanye West Net Worth" href=#>Kanye West</a>, Kim’s current boyfriend and father of her newly-born daughter. She said she knows everything as she has worked in the hotel where the two (Kim and Kanye) would have their secret rendezvous. This allegation is not new as West’s former girlfriend Amber Rose, claimed the same thing before. She said Kim was the main reason why she and Kanye broke up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was also reported that after the divorce, the $8 million basketball player is paying for the plastic surgery of his girlfriends to look like Kim Kardashian. Kris allegedly paid for Myla’s boob job amounting to $6,000 to turn her into Kim. Sinanaj has quite a resemblance with Kim, having the same hair and complexion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmakqpmoeqnBzKmfq6GVqHqwrtKeqqydlGLEqsDHZqKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
