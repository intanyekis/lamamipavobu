Hartwell filed court papers in Fulton County, Georgia, on Monday, July 25, citing irreconcilable differences, <i>Us Weekly</i> confirmed last Tuesday.</p><p>Hartwell has said he is unsure if he is the father of Knight Pulliam’s bundle of joy. “Right now, the only thing I want is a paternity test for the baby,” he told <a href=#>TheYBF.com</a> in a statement via his rep on July 25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>In a Thursday, July 28, interview with <a href=#>Page Six TV</a>, the athlete explained that he demanded a paternity test because Knight Pulliam started acting out, disappearing for days at a time and “sometimes not coming home at all” after they got into a fight over their differing opinions about starting a family.</p><p>“She wanted a baby really fast, and what I was trying to explain to her was that — from my beliefs, from seeing other successful people — that when you first get married, especially since we didn’t have a long courtship, that we should actually focus on each other and not just have a baby,” he explained. “That’s something she really did want to do.”</p><p>Though Hartwell believes Knight Pulliam might have cheated on him, the actress alleged to <i><a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> </i>on July 28 that he was the one who strayed in their relationship. As previously reported, the pair tied the knot after four months of dating at their Georgia home in a secret New Year’s Eve ceremony last December.</p><p>Despite the abrupt end of her marriage, Knight Pulliam is staying positive and looking forward to impending motherhood.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m not going to allow anyone to change how I love, because there are many blessings,” she told<i> ET</i>. “Despite where we are now, the biggest blessing is right here with me. I always say, ‘No regrets.’ You learn lessons. I’ve learned a very big lesson, and I’ll take that with me. Forgiveness isn’t for them — it’s for you. Hatred or ill will, you know, it only harms you. So I absolutely wish him the best. I absolutely hope that he finds whatever it is he’s looking for and needs to be happy, because the happier he is and the more fulfilled he is, the better dad he can be to our girl.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaknaOdtqJ5yqegoKCkYr22uMuimKZlkpa%2Fpr%2BMm5ibsV2Xwq68jJqdrZ2iYrGqws6rmp5llKeurq2MsGtsamhngnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
