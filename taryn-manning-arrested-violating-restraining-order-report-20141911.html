The allegation was false. It is unfortunate that additional false allegations by an individual convicted of violating orders of protection intended to protect Ms. Manning are facilitated by purported news organizations to perpetuate the harassment of Ms. Manning exponentially.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms. Manning is a law abiding person who has respect for the law and the privilege of her profession. The fact that there are no criminal charges against Ms. Manning with regard to the purported allegations against her is a clear demonstration of her innocence.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms. Manning will as always maintain the high road. She wishes no contact from Ms. Heller and has had to spend great sums to hire security for her protection.</p><p><strong>Original Story:</strong>&nbsp;Orange Is the New Black actress <strong>Taryn Manning</strong> was arrested for allegedly making criminal threats against her former friend <strong>Jeanine Heller</strong>, <a href=#>TMZ reports</a>. The star villain on the hit Netflix series had already been ordered to stay away from Heller after a judge previously issued a mutual domestic restraining order.&nbsp;</p><p>Manning, 36, allegedly violated this restraining order on Tuesday, Nov. 18 when TMZ claims she threatened to kill Heller via text and social media. Citing court documents, the site reports that the messages read, “I will kill you, bitch,” “Go f—k yourself and die,” and “What’s taking so long? Shouldn’t you be dead by now?”</p><p>The site also claims that Heller had been arrested in the past for violating the same order. But Manning claims there’s a different story than the one reported on TMZ.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Oh! That’s what happened huh? Id say get the ALL the facts correct before any posting @TMZ or tell the whole story. Let’s get it right!” she tweeted on Wednesday, Nov. 19. “There are no charges against me. This is just further harassment. It is troubling that the system can be used to abuse the actual victim.”</p><p>She continued to bash TMZ, writing, “For a phone call and a lot of time on your hands, you too can get a news media outlet to post totally incorrect information! #sarcastictweet. I guess my mom can’t have that mean crush she had on Harvey [Levin] anymore. Lol @TMZ we loved you silly guy!!!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Crossroads actress also posted an Instagram shot of a unicorn, writing, “I love my life everyday, happy and grateful to be alive. I have a very busy life and very little time for friends or to even see my family. I do not have time to harass or hurt anyone when I barely have time to take a shower some days. Lol. Reconsider before you believe anything you read. I’ve chosen the high road. You can only choose the high road with full confidence when you know you are innocent. When some people feel hurt they do things they don’t always understand. Sending healing prayers.”</p><p>Manning is best known for playing the meth-addicted, born-again Christian Tiffany “Pennsatucky” Doggett on the hit prison dramedy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmaKuu265wKeloqaXYq6zvsSsq56cXau2sLjAraCnn12nsrTA0Zqgp6GenHqwvsOeqWaqlaW8s8CMa2dqbGFufnJ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
