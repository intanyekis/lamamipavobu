His most recent movie release was “My Best Friend’s Girl” (2008). Deutch has been active in the entertainment industry since 1986.</p><p>How rich is the film and television director? It has been calculated by authoritative sources that the overall size of Howard Deutch’s net worth is as much as $25 million, as of the data presented in the middle of 2017, with films and television directing being the major sources of Deutch’s fortune.</p><h3>Howard Deutch Net Worth $25 Million</h3><p>To begin with, the boy was raised in New York City, the son of Pamela and Murray Deutch, a musical executive. He matriculated from George W. Hewlett High School and later graduated from Ohio State University.</p><p>He started his career in the advertising department of United Artists Records – at that time his father served as the president of the company. At first, Deutch directed music videos for artists such as <a href=#>Billy Joel</a> – “Keeping the Faith” – and <a href=#>Billy Idol</a> – “Flesh for Fantasy”. His feature film directing debut was “Pretty in Pink” (1986) written by <a href=#>John Hughes</a>&nbsp;and starring the Brat Pack. His following directing works including the romance film “Some Kind of Wonderful” (1987) and the comedy film “The Great Outdoors” (1988) were also written by <a href=#>Hughes</a>. In 1991, he won CableACE Award for his direction of an episode of the HBO series “Tales from the Crypt” called “Dead Right”; it should be said that Deutch has directed three sequels of films of which originals were created by other directors, which are the romantic comedy films “Grumpier Old Men” (1995), “The Odd Couple II” (1998) and the crime comedy film “The Whole Ten Yards” (2004), all adding to his net worth.</p><p>During breaks between films Howard has directed television series, including “Tales from the Crypt” (1989 – 1999), “Melrose Place” (1992) and “Caroline in the City” (1995). In 2008, Deutch directed the film “My Best Friend’s Girl” (2008), and since then he has been mainly active in directing various television. From 2012 to 2013, he worked with science fiction series “Warehouse 13” aired on Syfy. Then, he directed episodes of the dark fantasy horror television series “True Blood” (2013 – 2014). Deutch has also created single episodes of the series “Jane the Virgin” (2015) and “The Lizzie Borden Chronicles” (2015), and more recently he has been working with the series “Claws” (2017). Overall, all the above mentioned engagements in films and television have increased the total size of Deutch net worth.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of Howard Deutch, he married <a href=#>Lea Thompson</a> in 1989, having met her during filming “Some Kind of Wonderful” (1987). Howard and Lea are parents of two girls, Zoey Deutch and Madeleine Deutch – both are actresses.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=20.220131702728><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Howard Deutch</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$25 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 14, 1950</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 10" (1.78 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Film and television Director, Producer, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Ohio State University, George W.

It may be more glaring there because the groups are so distinct socially; but it doesn't let up as you get older. There's pressure in any business to choose a safe project, to go with the group. In corporations, there's pressure to be seen with the right people; to eat in the right restaurants; at all costs to avoid the smell of failure. A case in point was the pressure on me to choose a 'safer' title than "Pretty in Pink." You constantly have to fight to keep everything from being reduced to the lowest common denominator. Standing on your own is not a thing that ends in high school.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Director <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=director readability=6.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Outcast</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series 3 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CSI: Cyber</td><td>2015-2016</td><td>TV Series 2 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jane the Virgin</td><td>2015-2016</td><td>TV Series 2 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Strain</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series 2 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>The Lizzie Borden Chronicles</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Mini-Series 2 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Getting On</td><td>2013-2014</td><td>TV Series 5 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>American Horror Story</td><td>2013-2014</td><td>TV Series 3 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>True Blood</td><td>2013-2014</td><td>TV Series 5 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Warehouse 13</td><td>2012-2013</td><td>TV Series 2 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CSI: NY</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Emily Owens M.D.</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Harry's Law</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ringer</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Jane by Design</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hung</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Big Love</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Life Unexpected</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>My Best Friend's Girl</td><td>2008</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Whole Ten Yards</td><td>2004</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gleason</td><td>2002</td><td>TV Movie</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Watching Ellie</td><td>2002</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Billy Joel: The Essential Video Collection</td><td>2001</td><td>Video video "Keeping the Faith", as Howie Deutch</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Replacements</td><td>2000</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Caroline in the City</td><td>1996-1998</td><td>TV Series 4 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Odd Couple II</td><td>1998</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Billy Joel: Greatest Hits Volume III</td><td>1997</td><td>Video documentary video "Keeping The Faith"</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Grumpier Old Men</td><td>1995</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Getting Even with Dad</td><td>1994</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Melrose Place</td><td>1992</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Article 99</td><td>1992</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tales from the Crypt</td><td>1989-1990</td><td>TV Series 2 episodes</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Great Outdoors</td><td>1988</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Some Kind of Wonderful</td><td>1987</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pretty in Pink</td><td>1986</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Year of Spectacular Men</td><td>2016</td><td>producer post-production</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Outcast</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series co-executive producer -
