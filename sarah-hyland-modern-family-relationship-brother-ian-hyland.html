Their parents only had two children, so Sarah and Ian are each other's only siblings. The two grew up with parents who were actors, so naturally, they both gravitated towards that same field of work. The duo also share a love for dogs and a passion for supporting women.</p><h2 id=sarah-hyland-and-her-brother-grew-up-acting><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sarah Hyland And Her Brother Grew Up Acting</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like his older sister Sarah, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Hyland grew up acting</a>. His first major role was in the 2004 Adam Sandler movie, Spanglish, in which Ian portrayed the role of Georgie. He has also appeared in episodes of various television shows including Weeds and 30 Rock. He graduated from Chapman University in Orange County in 2017, and of course, his sister attended the ceremony. He graduated from the Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. Ian most recently had a role in a short film called 20 Red Balloons, which was released in 2020.</p><h2 id=sarah-hyland-and-her-brother-share-a-love-of-dogs><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sarah Hyland And Her Brother Share A Love Of Dogs</span></h2><p>Ian and his sister Sarah both share a love for dogs, according to their Instagram feeds. Sarah spends a lot of her time at home with her and her fiancé's dogs, Boo and Carl. Ian is clearly madly in love with his own dog, Barkley, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Maltipoo that used to be Sarah's</a>. Ian also loves being an uncle to Boo and Carl and his girlfriend is apparently a cat lover and has two cats of her own that she shares with him. Wells, Sarah's fiancé, has an Instagram account for his dog, Carl, the bloodhound, that features a video of him playing with Ian, with a caption that says "I love my uncle."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's Sarah Hyland Been Up To Since 'Modern Family' Ended?</a></span></p><h2 id=sarah-hyland-and-her-brother-love-each-other-a-lot><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sarah Hyland And Her Brother Love Each Other A Lot</span></h2><p>As evidenced by their posts about each other over the years on Instagram, Sarah and Ian have a mutual love and respect for one another that not all siblings do. For Sarah's birthday in 2017, Ian posted a photo of the two of them as kids on his Instagram page, with a caption that read "when Sarah and I were kids we used to fight all the time - a 4 year age gap is a big one when you're a kid. My mom always used to say that we'd be closer when we were older, and I wasn't quite sure I believed her." He went on to say "I just want to say how proud I am of the incredible woman she has grown to become. She is smart. She is insanely talented. She is wildly independent. I am glad mom was right and I am glad to be your brother." So dang sweet!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-hyland-39-s-brother-donated-his-kidney-to-her><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sarah Hyland's Brother Donated His Kidney To Her</span></h2><p>On September 19, 2019, Sarah posted a tribute to her brother on Instagram saying that two years prior to that day, he donated his kidney to her to save her life. <a href=#>Sarah was born with a condition called kidney dysplasia</a>, which means that her kidneys didn't quite form correctly in the womb. She received a kidney from her father years earlier, but unfortunately, her body ended up rejecting it. So Sarah's brother Ian, came in and saved her life by giving her his kidney. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian also posted a tribute to Sarah on the 2-year kidneyversary</a>, saying "I am so happy that you are living your dreams and have such an incredible year and life ahead of you. You make me so proud to be your brother. I love you, sis!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Sarah Hyland Enjoy Starring On 'Modern Family'?</a></span></p><h2 id=sarah-hyland-and-her-brother-fight-for-women-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sarah Hyland And Her Brother Fight For Women Together</span></h2><p>In January 2018, Sarah was asked to speak at the Women's March in Los Angeles. Her brother kindly showed up to the march to support her and all women. He took a photo with her at the march, with the two wearing matching "Times Up" t-shirts, and holding up signs featuring motivational quotes. Ian's sign said "we must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim." Sarah stated in her Instagram post from that day that "to stand in solidarity and speak about unity with my fierce sisters and supportive brothers meant the world to me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-hyland-and-her-brother-party-together><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sarah Hyland And Her Brother Party Together</span></h2><p>Even though they are both grown, they still party together and gather on holidays when they can. Ian has been seen in photos from Sarah's Thanksgiving dinners as well as Halloween parties over the years. They even posed for photos together with their significant others at Sarah's latest Halloween party. Ian's girlfriend captioned a set of photos from that night with "it's always a magical time under the Hyladams roof." It's nice to see the two enjoy having fun together.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Modern Family Helped Sarah Hyland's Net Worth Reach $14 million</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmqqRnXqpxcuapZ1lnaSxpr7NZp2apZmhxm6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mmaunpJ2ys3nImqVmoKmhrq%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
