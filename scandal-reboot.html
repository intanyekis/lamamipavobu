Bellamy Young Responds to Rumors</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>It’s been almost six years since the <a href=# rel=noopener>end of Scandal</a>, but there’s at least one star who’s ready to return to Capitol Hill — and she’s prepared to bring the rest of the cast back with her too.</p><p>When asked about the chances of a <a href=# rel=noopener>Scandal reboot</a> at the American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women Red Dress Collection Concert in New York on January 31, Bellamy Young, who played Mellie Grant in the original series, confirmed that the whole cast would be “down” to come back for another go around. “I will say today is both Kerry [Washington]’s and Porta [de Rossi]’s birthdays, so the Scandal thread has been popping today. I think everybody would be down,” she said.</p><p>As for what the series could be about, Soaps asked what she would name the Scandal reboot if the show was centered around Mellie. “I didn’t know it was going to be based on Mellie though, so I need to think for a second,” she said. When asked what she thought about the title Mellificent, Young laughed and said,&nbsp;“I think it’s been done, but let’s do it again. I’m not good with [coming up with names]. So let’s go with Mellificent.”</p><p>Scandal was ABC’s drama series following Olivia Pope, a self-proclaimed fixer, who ran the crisis management firm, Olivia Pope & Associates. The series revolved around Olivia’s team as they fix PR scandals around the political scene in Washington D.C. — including Olivia’s secret affair with the President of the United States, Fitzgerald Grant III, who is married to Young’s character, Mellie, the First Lady.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Bellamy-Young-Scandal-2.jpg alt="Bellamy Young - Scandal" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Scandal, which was created by Shonda Rhimes, premiered in 2012 and ran for sevn seasons until its series finale in 2018. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Extra</a> in December 2023, Washington also confirmed she would be down for a Scandal reboot movie. “That is a question for Shonda Rhimes. I will be there if it happens,” she said.</p><p>It could be a reality. Rhimes told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">IMdb</a> in May 2024 about which of her characters she would love to bring back. “Oh, Olivia Pope,” she said. “I like that character so much, even when she was bad. I like that character so much, she’s very interesting.”</p><p><strong>Check out our gallery below for who your <a href=# rel=noopener>favorite primetime stars are dating and married to in real life</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYWuDcoSOrJqappSWuW6%2BxJumqKxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
