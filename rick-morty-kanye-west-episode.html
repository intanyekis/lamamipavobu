While the show's creators have hyped up this much anticipated collaboration, the big wig execs aren't quite sure if it will follow through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rumors of Kanye's involvement with Rick & Morty date back to 2019, when the men behind the show -&nbsp;Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon - openly offered the rapper his own episode. This was in light of West's open admiration for the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West Facing $2 Million Lawsuit From 2020 Presidential Campaign</a></span></p><p>Upon the show's renewal for a new season in 2019, West took to Twitter to say, "This is the greatest news. This is my favorite show. I’ve seen every episode at least 5 times each."</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blast</a>, Roiland responded to the tweet saying, "We love Kanye, man. He’s a kindred spirit, genius, visionary . . . If that guy had the support to do all the ideas he has in his head, it would be Elon Musk 2.0."</p><p>Partner in crime, Harmon cemented the rumors by adding, "I’m giving him an episode,&nbsp; I’m making it official. We have 70, he can have one. Kanye, you can have an episode.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>New developments have arisen in regards to the episode as Harmon appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MSNBC</a>&nbsp;on Friday. He discussed the current status of the episode, which is a bit murky.</p><p>"I think that when Kanye signs on, as he did, to do an episode, it won't just be Kanye doing a guest voice or <a href=#>Kanye doing a song</a>," Harmon explains, "We agreed that it needed to be really interwoven with the Rick and Morty franchise having its own integrity and Kanye having his own, without spoiling any details of what that story would be. Suffice it to say, the end result was going to be a lot of original music."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>West made a trip to the Adult Swim headquarters to meet with staff writers and discuss the logistics of the episode. According to Harmon, West was more than willing to sign off and get things started. Though, things got tricky when exes got into the mix.</p><p>"At that point," Harmon adds, "that was when seven different corporations -and I don't fault them for this because this is their job — they have to say, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Slow down psychos. What are you doing?"</p><p>The ins and outs of pre-production and music licensing may have put a momentary halt on the Kanye West X Ricky & Morty collab. But, with a whole season to look forward to, fans of the show yearn for the day when the two worlds collide.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next: <a href=#>Every Cast Member of Rick And Morty's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ComicBook.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blast</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MSNBC</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Fqq%2FKZqSoqqSueqytzbKcZq%2BVqMFusc%2BiqqiclWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
