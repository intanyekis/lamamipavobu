It fits perfectly with Sterling,’” Patrick explained at the time. “So, we went with that.”</p><p>Patrick continued: “It works out well. He can have his own thing now where he’s not Patrick, he’s Bronze, even though he’s Patrick. And, Sterling and Bronze can have that connection moving forward.”</p><p>Patrick and Brittany had previously welcomed Sterling in February 2021. “Sterling Skye Mahomes 2/20/21,” Patrick wrote via Instagram, showing a picture of the newborn’s hand with theirs. Brittany, for her part, wore a necklace with their daughter’s name, and added that the baby girl weighed 6 lbs 11 oz.</p><p>More than one year later, the two tied the knot in Hawaii in March 2022. Patrick and Brittany, who began dating in high school, got engaged in August 2020 after his Super Bowl LIV win earlier that year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple have previously opened up about <a href=#>spending time together</a> — and with their little ones — during Patrick’s off season.</p><p>“We like to spend time as a family,” Brittany said in August at the ESPYs. “I call this the real season for me when I have two kids at home,” Patrick quipped.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapmaSntqS3jJqlnWWSp7a1wMCnsGalkZ28rrHSZquhqp%2BserS7zWaYZp6fpMGjrculZK2glaKypXnBoqmtoJSWxm6uwKyfaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
