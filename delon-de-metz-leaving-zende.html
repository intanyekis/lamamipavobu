Sure, at first it sounded a little… er, rough. But it all became clear eventually.</p><p>“I had a great time getting the s#!t kicked out of my by my big bro Shemar Moore during my guest [starring role] on S.W.A.T!” said de Metz on Instagram. And it took us a minute, but we eventually put together the pieces and realized that what we were seeing was sort of a crossover between the two CBS soaps. Because, of course, you’ll recall that Moore will forever be loved by&nbsp;Young & Restless fans for his stint as Lily’s biological dad Malcolm.</p><p>“This character was a big departure from the roles I typically play,” continued Zende’s portrayer, adding that it “shows me in a wildly different light.” As for details, he would only coyly promise to “post more when the episode airs.”</p><p>Getting into the spirit of the post, Riley Rasmussen responded that she was “so excited to see you get beat up!” Added Tracey McDaniel, “Might as well get your butt kicked by the best!” Meanwhile, several Bold & Beautiful&nbsp;co-stars, including Ashley Jones (Bridget) and Lawrence Saint-Victor (Carter).</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>The rewrite that is, quite frankly, bull.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Although Moore left&nbsp;Young & Restless&nbsp;in 2009 — and actor Darius McCrary played a recast Malcolm until 2011 — he has never forgotten his time on the soap or failed to acknowledge the important role it played in his career. In fact, he has returned several times, most recently in May of 2023, when Malcolm joined the residents of Genoa City to pay tribute to his late brother, Neil. In real-life Moore was extremely close to Neil’s portrayer, Kristoff St. John, who passed away in 2019.</p><p>As for de Metz, he’s been doing a fine job of balancing the rigors of a daytime role with forays into primetime. Last year, he appeared in an exciting episode of&nbsp;9-1-1, and now comes&nbsp;S.W.A.T., leaving us to wonder where he’ll pop up next! One thing’s for sure: He won’t be stepping away from&nbsp;Bold & Beautiful&nbsp;anytime soon, what with Zende caught up in a frontburner — if somewhat controversial — storyline!</p><p><strong>We’ve got your complete guide to all the actors who’ve joined and/or left Bold & Beautiful&nbsp;in recent months <a href=# rel=noopener>in this gallery</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmraCVYq%2BwuMNmmKecXam1pnnBnpiurJmbwq17wqikoqaXqHqiusNmnqihnpzAcIOQcmlqal%2BZsq27zWabnmWdmsG7ecuemK%2Bhnpx6u7HNnZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
