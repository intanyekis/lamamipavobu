Horacio Vela filed a complaint against the 67-year-old Succession actor in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</p><p>In the complaint, Vela claimed negligence and sought an amount of money that was not specified about a collision that happened at the intersection of N La Brea Ave. and Hollywood Blvd. in Hollywood at around 9:01 p.m. on October 31.</p><p>The driver claims Ruck caused a chain-reaction crash in Hollywood that left the driver seriously injured and his car wrecked. Horacio Vela’s attorneys are suing Ruck for an undisclosed sum of money, claiming the actor was negligent, as filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court’s seven-page complaint.</p><p>An NBC News request for comment was not immediately answered by Ruck’s representatives.</p><p>When Los Angeles fire authorities got on the scene, they discovered a three-vehicle collision with one vehicle’s front end partially within a small business structure. Two unidentified individuals were called for ambulances, and a 32-year-old male was taken to the hospital.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Alan-Ruck-1024x576.jpg><p>The complaint states that Vela was sitting at a red light at Hollywood Boulevard and La Brea Avenue when his Hyundai Elantra was violently hit by a Rivian R1T pickup truck driver, subsequently recognised as Ruck.</p><p>Vela claims that the force of the hit threw his automobile into the intersection, crashing into a car and turning into La Brea Avenue. Vela’s car was pulled from the site, and he was taken by EMS to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre.</p><p>Vela’s lawyers claim that after losing consciousness from the impact, medical personnel informed him that he suffered a subdural hematoma. His attorneys claim that his current memory problems, fogginess, and dizziness are signs of brain damage.</p><p>According to NBC Los Angeles, security camera footage captured Ruck’s Rivian pickup rear-ending a car at a stoplight and then hitting a BMW SUV before stopping partly inside the pizza place.</p><p>Vela’s lawyer, Neama Rahmani, told NBC News, “Accidents happen. That’s what insurance is for. But <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=1162>Alan Ruck’s</a> insurance company, State Farm, has refused to accept responsibility for the crash.”</p><p>“Ruck says he doesn’t know what happened, and the Los Angeles Police Department says it was a vehicle issue, while Rivian, the manufacturer, says the truck was working properly,” Rahmani said.</p><p>“In this case, multiple people were hit, and a business was damaged. We believe Ruck is responsible for the damages, and we filed a lawsuit to subpoena evidence and witnesses to prove our case.”</p><p>Throughout his forty-year career, Ruck has been involved in numerous television and film projects, including Spin City. His performance of Connor Roy on HBO’s Succession garnered him a nomination for a 2023 Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series earlier this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kuaLAxKyrZqCfqXyiuMCnZKutk6B6oq%2FTqKlmoZ5iwLavwp6qrKGfo3qiusNmnZ6qop7Abq7UnqOlnaKoeqWt2Gamn55dqMKmsIyorZ6qXZZ6qbvLpbCwp5%2BZerG12bOYZpmTmLalsc2tZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
