We got up at 3:30 and headed out to Alberta Peak so that we could hike to the top by sunrise. It was already one of my most favorite hikes in Pagosa, but this experience made me fall in love with it even more,‚Äù Ferrell wrote alongside the video, which was set to <strong>Tyler Childers</strong>‚Äô song ‚ÄúShake This Frosts‚Äù and filmed via a drone. ‚ÄúWe reached the trail head at about 4:30 and started the trek up. It was pitch black and we had to wear headlamps to be able to see the trail, but the full moon helped and was also more than beautiful. It was dead silent other than our footsteps and heavy breathing, and there was not a soul in sight. When we reached the top we were excited to be the only ones up there. That on top of the world feeling was absolutely unreal!‚Äù</p><p>Ferrell went on to call the hike ‚Äúone of the top 10 best date of my life.‚Äù</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>‚ÄúWe hadn‚Äôt really used the drone a whole lot before, and the wind made it pretty challenging. Also, after being strapped to the backpack on the hike up, the battery was too cold and being glitchy. We were so nervous it was gonna fail or catch a gust of wind and crash over the peak! üôà (so take it easy on the drone footage criticism),‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúAnd if you ever get the chance to #visitpagosa I highly recommend it. ‚ù§Ô∏è I LOVE YOU COLORADO!‚Äù</p><p>Us confirmed in December 2018 that Ferrell and Vanloo, who previously deleted all traces of each other on their respective social media accounts, split after two years of marriage. An insider told Us at the time that they had been ‚Äúon the rocks‚Äù since their nuptials.</p><p>Ferrell rose to fame in 2014 after scoring<a href=#><strong> Juan Pablo Galavis</strong></a>‚Äô final rose on season 18 of The Bachelor. After dating for several months, however, the twosome called it quit. Galavis, for his part, married<a href=#><strong> Osmariel Villalobos</strong> in Miami in August 2017.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270axkp6GboLZussSrqZ6knGK1tr%2FBmqWdZaSuuaa%2BjK%2BYp6SfpHqzsdSnoK2dXZaztbHRZqqppJmpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
