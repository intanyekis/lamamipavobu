Assane, incarcerated, finds himself serving time alongside none other than his longtime nemesis, Hubert Pellegrini.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Assane’s Audacious Heist and New Adversary</strong></h2><p>The character of Mariama is introduced in Part 3 as Assane’s mother. While the fate of Assane’s father is known—he was framed by Pellegrini and perished in prison during the 1990s—very little is known about his mother.</p><p>It is revealed that she remained in Senegal while Assane and his father emigrated. Her efforts to join her family in France were thwarted when her employer unjustly reduced her wages.</p><p>In a desperate turn of events, she turned to a life of crime. After 25 years, she finally arrives in Paris, only to be kidnapped.</p><p>Assane’s audacious attempt to steal the Black Pearl, a priceless jewel from the Franco-Tahitian war, serves as a central plot point. This daring heist was one of Assane’s rare failures back in 2017 when he was apprehended during the attempt.</p><p>However, in Part 3, he devises a new plan. He boldly notifies the jewel’s owners of his intentions and even leaks his elaborate scheme to the press.</p><p>This move garners support from citizens who assemble outside the location of the Black Pearl to cheer him on.</p><p>Assane assumes the guise of one of the police officers guarding the pearl, ultimately executing a breathtaking heist and a daring escape that unfolds on the rooftops of Paris, witnessed by a captivated audience.</p><p>Assane resorts to faking his own death as a means to escape the relentless media scrutiny aimed at his ex-partner Claire and his son Raoul.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lupin-Part-3-Ending-Explained-1024x576.jpg><p>With the assistance of Benjamin, posing as a doctor performing his autopsy, Assane leaks a photograph of his supposedly lifeless body and goes as far as being buried alive, complete with a trap door in the coffin.</p><p>His intent is to gather as many witnesses as possible to his demise and burial, although some of those closest to him remain skeptical about his actual fate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jean-Luc Keller’s Revenge and Assane’s Sacrifice</strong></h2><p>The character Jean-Luc Keller, Assane’s former mentor, makes a return in Part 3. He once operated a boxing gym frequented by young Assane and Bruno in the 1990s.</p><p>Keller, a figure akin to Fagin from “Oliver Twist,” coerced his vulnerable young protégés into a life of crime, which eventually led to his 25-year imprisonment following a heist gone awry.</p><p>Upon his release, Keller seeks revenge and kidnaps Assane’s mother to inflict the utmost pain on his former ward.</p><p>Keller uses Mariama as leverage, forcing Assane to engage in a series of progressively challenging heists, including stealing Manet’s Chez Tortoni, a valuable gem-studded bracelet, and selling the Black Pearl, despite the world now knowing the identity of the thief.</p><p>As Assane unravels the identity of his blackmailer and devises a plan to thwart the extortion, he strives to save his mother.</p><p>While Assane intends to reveal his continued existence to his family and lead them to a peaceful life in the countryside, he becomes entangled in the crisis of his mother’s abduction and the subsequent blackmail.</p><p>While his son Raoul maintains faith in his father’s survival, Claire, his wife, remains skeptical.</p><p>Claire ultimately uncovers the truth from Benjamin, who has been captured during the bracelet heist.</p><p>She eventually recognizes that Assane has been covertly checking in on her and Raoul, adopting prosthetic disguises to pose as Raoul’s new basketball coach, Alex.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Boston Connection and Detective Guedira’s Assistance</strong></h2><p>A link between the Lupin series and a famous art heist in Boston is uncovered when Assane’s blackmailer instructs him to steal Chez Tortoni from a French mobster’s mother’s residence.</p><p>Assane recalls that the Manet painting was stolen in 1990 in Boston.</p><p>This reference is made to the real-life unsolved robbery of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, chronicled in the series “This Is a Robbery: The World’s Biggest Art Heist.”</p><p>The painting’s connection to France raises intriguing questions about its whereabouts over the years.</p><p>Assane recruits Detective Youssef Guedira, a Paris detective who has been obsessed with catching him.</p><p>Youssef was instrumental in deducing that Assane drew inspiration from Arsène Lupin, a character from Maurice Leblanc’s novels.</p><p>Although Lieutenant Sofia Belkacem is officially in charge of the case, Youssef’s relentless pursuit of Assane leads to his dismissal from the investigation.</p><p>His obsession with Assane is so consuming that Assane tracks him down, seeking his assistance in capturing Keller. Assane promises to turn himself in once his mother is safe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Calculated Surrender, Assane’s Bold Decision</strong></h2><p>Assane’s decision to turn himself in is not a consequence of getting caught; rather, it is a calculated choice he makes to ensure the freedom and safety of his family, including his mother, wife, son, and best friend.</p><p>After guiding Belkacem and Guedira to Keller’s location, Assane steps out of the shadows and surrenders.</p><p>He imposes conditions that include Benjamin’s release, the opportunity to explain his decision to Claire, and the provision of a comprehensive set of Arsène Lupin books for his prison cell.</p><p>The authorities agree to these terms, and Part 3 concludes with Assane behind bars, albeit temporarily.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kwbd7y66noqZdpa6zwIxsZJ6mlJ67qHnEsaelmZmjsqV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JotBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
